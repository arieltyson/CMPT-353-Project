The game is considered to be won if you reach the number 2048 by sliding the same numbers together.

The statistic function is also part of the app. This makes it possible to get information about for example the required number of swipes and the highest achieved number of points.

The Privacy Friendly 2048 has four different game modes:

classic: 4x4
large: 5x5
bigger: 6x6
huge: 7x7

A generator in the background randomly displays one number per round (2 or 4). With the help of these numbers, the number 2048 and even higher powers of two can be gradually reached. For help and tips, please take a look at this website.

This app also offers the possibility to save a game in the respective mode, which allows a total of up to four saved games. Undoing a move has also been implemented in this app. Additionally, a summary of their performance in the different modes can be found in the statistic function.

Our Privacy Friendly App differs from other, similar applications with respect to two aspects:

1. No permissions:
The Privacy Friendly 2048 does not use any permissions
2. No adertisement:
Many other free apps in the Google Play Store dazzle annoying advertising which also shortens battery life.

How to play.
Swipe the game board to move all tiles left, right, up, or down.
When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one with a double number,
i.e. 2+2 merge into 4, 4+4 merge into 8 and so on.
The goal is to create a tile with the highest number.
Number 2048 is a good first win…

Features of ""2048 Open Fun Game"" that are not present in the original game:

* Unlimited and animated Undo and Redo.
* Retries counter. When you make a move after Undo (no matter if it is the same move as before or another move),
  number of Retries increases. The counter shows total number of retries done during the game
  and allows comparing different results more fairly.
* Select theme for the app: Device default (for Android 9+), Dark or Light.
  Dark theme for Android 9+ is turned on by default when system-wide ""Dark theme"" is turned on in device settings.
* Different portrait and landscape screen layouts. Portrait layout is more or less classic for the 2048 game,
  and landscape layout allows using screen space better and have larger board.
* Turn on AI (Artificial Intelligence) mode and let the AI play for you.
  Increase or decrease AI player speed. Stop it and continue playing yourself.
  Choose one of several AI algorithms, see how they play and compare them.
* Bookmarks at the interesting game positions. Return to a bookmark and play again from that place.
* Move number and game duration shown. The time starts when you make a move.

  stop at any position.
  Switch to ""Play"" mode from that place and continue playing, overriding history.

  Or you can play them again from any position / bookmark.
* Game menu allows you to delete current game from history, to restart a game (""Try again"")
  or to open recent game from a list.
* When you tap ""Try again"" button or open recent game, current game is automatically saved to the history,
  so you can review or continue to play it later.

Usability Guide

So, what capabilities does 8Vim have? Once you know how to type with this thing (Learn how to type with this original [8Pen-game video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99vsUF4NuLk), you must know the following
Basic Needed Stuff

Right Sector acts as a backspace Key.
Bottom Sector acts as a Enter Key.
Top Sector acts as a combination of SHIFT and CAPS_LOCK Key, i.e, Press once Shift is active, Press Twice CAPS is active and Press once more and everything is back to usual.
Left Sector acts as the button that takes you to the Number Pad.

Cursor Movements

If you move your finger from the centre-circle to any sector and stay, the cursor movement will be emulated. For example, if you swipe from circle->right, the cursor will move right. You get the picture.

Selection

There is selection built in to the keyboard. if you move your finger from the right sector to the circle, the cursor will start moving left and selecting everything in it's path. once you release, a selection keyboard will open up for various stupidities to do.

Paste Functionality

Moving your finger from right->circle->lift-your-finger performs a paste. whatever is in the clipboard.

<b>Compatibility</b>
Aegis supports the HOTP and TOTP algorithms. These two algorithms are industry-standard and widely supported, making Aegis compatible with thousands of services. Any web service that supports Google Authenticator will also work with Aegis Authenticator.

<b>Encryption and biometric unlock</b>
All of your one-time passwords are stored in a vault. If you choose to set a password (highly recommended), the vault will be encrypted using strong cryptography. If someone with malicious intent gets a hold of the vault file, it’s impossible for them to retrieve the contents without knowing the password. Entering your password each time you need access to a one-time password can be cumbersome. Fortunately, you can also enable biometric unlock if your device has a biometrics sensor (i.e. fingerprint or face unlock).

<b>Organization</b>
Over time, you'll likely accumulate tens of entries in your vault. Aegis Authenticator has lots of organization options to make finding the one you need at a particular moment easier. Set a custom icon for an entry to make it easier to find. Search by account name or service name. Have a lot of one-time passwords? Add them to custom groups for easier access. Personal, Work and Social can each get their own group.

<b>Backups</b>
To make sure you will never lose access to your online accounts, Aegis Authenticator can create automatic backups of the vault to a location of your choosing. If your cloud provider supports the Storage Access Framework of Android (like Nextcloud does), it can even create automatic backups to the cloud. Creating manual exports of the vault is also supported.

<b>Making the switch</b>
To make the switch easier, Aegis Authenticator can import the entries of lots of other authenticators, including: 2FAS Authenticator, Authenticator Plus, Authy, andOTP, FreeOTP, FreeOTP+, Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, Steam, TOTP Authenticator and WinAuth (root access is required for the apps that don't have an option to export).

Do you worry about your private pictures or files appearing in other apps?
That's where Aer private storage comes in. Files in Aer storage won't appear in the other apps.

Note: Aer is in development 🏗️. Accidents happen. Please keeps backups 👷‍♀️ for your protection.

Instead of being a stand-alone file manager, Aer hooks into various components of Android,
making it feel like a native part of the operating system. Moreover, it provides ways for the user
to export contents from other apps and save them in Aer storage.

<em>Features</em>

<ul>
<li> Create folders and organize files freely
<li> All files in the Aer private storage won't appear in the other apps
<li> Access using the system Files application (the DocumentsProviderUI)
    <li> An optional shortcut is offered for devices that do not expose the system Files app
    <li> The system Files app is also used as file picker, so you can pick Aer files to share
<li> Lock access to the private storage
    <li> Quick tile
    <li> Auto lock after set delay (experimental)
    <li> Password for locking access to the files
<li> Import content into Aer using the Android share functionality
</ul>

<em>Aer vs Anemo</em>

In addition to Anemo features above, Aer adds support for external storage, like encrypted SD cards.
When available Aer will store your files on external storage (which tend to have larger capacity).
This also allows accessing your private files on your computer when connected using USB cable (MTP).
The storage backend used is also manually configurable.

The source code is dated and not shiny, and there are several hacks used in order to make a graphical widget work on Android. The source code is made public domain as it may provide utility for others.

The app scans your surroundings in the background to find trackers such as AirTags, Samsung SmartTags or Google Find My Device trackers. If the app finds out that a tracker is following you, you will receive a notification.

These trackers are only the size of a coin and are often used to track people. Unfortunately, each tracker works differently, so you often need multiple apps to detect tracking.
AirGuard combines the detection of different trackers so you only need one app to keep you safe.

Once a tracker has been found, you can make it ring (doesn't work on all models) or go searching with a manual scan.
If you find a tracker, we advise you to deactivate it so that it no longer tracks your location.

The app only saves your location locally to show you later where a tracker has followed you. This app never shares personal data.

If the app does not find any trackers, then the app will not bother you.

* can enter input by button presses, typing, or copy/pasting. Button presses are all converted to plaintext input for easy copy/pasting.
* equation display is simplified upon pressing enter. This means that when entering an equation, it is usually possible to look only at the LaTeX display and not the plaintext input: but when pressing enter, it will look nice. Redundant brackets are removed, including those that are needed for plaintext input (e.g. `(a + b)/(c + d)` can become ""a + b"" on the numerator and ""c + d"" on the denominator without brackets).
* light/dark themes

running apps on boot or fastboot.

This app solves that problem. When the Phoenix Radio boots (or fast-boots), 
the Alt Launcher starts the apps it is configured to start. The primary purpose 
is to launch two apps in split screen mode. You can select which app to be on 
the top half of the screen, and the app for the bottom half. Prior to starting 
those apps, it can launch services or apps that need to run in the background.

Installation Note: The Alt Launcher does not show up in the launcher that comes 
with the Phoenix radios. During the installation process, be sure to click the 
""Open"" button to run it once. From that point on, it will run in the 
background. If you don't start it during the installation process, the only way 
to start it is with another app that launches apps (like CarWebGuru).

Accessing the app

To get into the Alt Launcher, swipe down from the top of the screen to view 
notifications, and click on the ""Alt Launcher"" notification. It has the 
message ""Foreground Service Started"". If the notification is not available, 
start the Alt Launcher using a non-stock launcher like CarWebGuru.

In the main scren, the Alt Launcher displays the services, background apps, and top and bottom apps it is configured to start on booot or fast boot.

Background Apps

At the top of the main screen is the list of apps that will start and then be 
put in the background. They are started in the order shown. To add a new one, 
click the ""Add a new Background App"" button, and select the desired app. To 
remove an app from the list, click on that app.

Services

Below the background apps is the list of services that will be started. They 
are started in the order shown. To add a new one, click the ""Add New Service to 
Start"" button, and select the desired service. To remove a service, click on 
the service.

Top and Bottom Apps

Below the background apps are the two apps to launch in split screen mode. To 
select the top or bottom app, click on either ""None Selected"" or the app shown 
in either the top or bottom sections, and choose the desired app in the popup.

Permissions

The app requires the following permissions:
1. RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED - needed to be notified after cold boot so it can launch the apps.
2. FOREGROUND_SERVICE - The default launcher on Phoenix Radios hides the application icon for the Alt Launcher. This means that by default, there is no way to get into the app to update configuration. The foreground service provides a consistent way to get back into the app.

Tasker

To start Tasker so that it starts performing actions after boot, do the 
following:

1. Select the following Tasker service to be launched: 
com.joaomgcd.taskerm.plugin.ServiceRequestQuery
i. There is generally no need to launch the Tasker app itself.
2. In Tasker, if you set up a profile with Profile->Event->Tasker->
Monitor Start, that activates when Tasker starts up.

don't believe the words.

we just offer you a standardized xmpp-client with predicted features which work equally on all platforms.
in our clients we have realized pure XMPP and you won't step on a hedgehog unexpectedly when you communicate with another xmpp client or server.

because you buy our open-sourced bitcoin,
we decided to offer you to buy our open-sourced messenger.
ha-ha joke.
it's free, really. GPLv3, whatever.

for Android, it's just an improved fork of Conversations,

all necessary XEP's was realized by Conversations devs but we added a cherry on top of this.
on the server side we are offering free to use Prosody server,
just connect to [another.im](xmpp:xmppclient-dev@conference.another.im), but we are encouroge you to don't trust us, self-host.

OTR encryption is also supported as 'secret chats' due to otr has been designed for one-time sessions and the concept of 'secret chats' fully corresponds to the idea of the OTR.

also you can just download <a href=""https://dev.narayana.im/narayana/anotherim"">the source code</a>, compile it and install.

ANOTHERpass generates easy but strong passwords for you. It uses so called <i>Pseudo Phrases</i> by default which looks like real words but are still very random and unpredictable.

It also comes with a clever two factor authentication to unlock the vault. These factors are knowledge (a PIN) and ownership (the master password). So instead of remembering a long and complicated master password you just remember the PIN and have your master password with you (as QR code or NFC tag). Additionally you can safely store it on your device using biometrics (e.g. fingerprint).

You can also access the vault from your laptop at home, if you use the <a href=""https://anotherpass.jepfa.de/extension"">ANOTHERpass Browser Extension</a>.

<b>Core features of the app</b>

- easy two factor authentication
- no complicated master password to memorize, it is just exported
- easy to read generated passwords
- strong modern encryption (AES 128/256, Blowfish, Chacha20)
- uses an integrated security chip or TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) if present
- Autofill support
- works with the <a href=""https://anotherpass.jepfa.de/extension"">ANOTHERpass Browser Extension</a> to share credentials within a local network (e.g. from the app to the desktop PC)
- biometrics (e.g. fingerprint) to use stored master password
- no insecure clipboard function by default
- show passwords over other apps to type it easily
- no data is stored in the cloud, except if the user itself backups files in the cloud
- export and import credential vault
- export vault and master key separately (latter analogue if wished)
- share and outsource credentials
- one-time-password support (HOTP and TOTP)
- obfuscate several passwords as additional security layer
- optional self destruction mode after too many failed login attempts
- Dark theme support ;-)

<b>Additional features include:</b>
• set bookmarks
• adjust playback speed

<b>Usage</b>
Start off by adding directories to your library. When adding a new directory you have two options:
• You can add a directory that contains audio files
• You can add a directory that contains subdirectories which contain audio files

For example, you might have a directory <i>Podcast History Hour</i> that contains audio files. Add this directory to your library using the option <i>Add directory that contains audio files</i>.
Additionally, you might have a directory <i>AudioBooks</i> that contains subdirectories such as <i>The Hobbit</i> or <i>Harry Potter II</i> each of which contains one or several audio files. You can add this directory to your library using the option <i>Add directory with subdirectories that contain audio files</i>.
This prevents you from having to add your audio books one by one.

Add cover images to the subdirectories to have a neat looking app as shown in the screenshots.

It's quite hard to keep this app working across the many different hardwares as well as the many changes Android undergoes over the versions. I can test it in the emulator, but that cannot show all bugs.
So if a certain feature is not working on your device - let me know. Over the years I have fixed almost all bugs that have been reasonably reported to me. But for that I'm dependend on your input.

If you have a problem and think about contacting me please
- update to the latest version first and see if your problem persists there, too.
- check this list of known problems first: https://server47.de/automation/index.php#knownProblems

Donations are certainly a good, but not the only way to motivate me :-)
* If you'd like to support me, you can also leave a positive review for the app on Google Play (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jens.automation2).
* If you like the app, simply some warm words via email are always appreciated.
* Furthermore I can always use help in translating the app. English, German and some Spanish are among my own skills. Italiano e russo sono già coperti. But everything else is more than welcome.
* If you have a talent/experience in graphics design and have some ideas for nicer icons let me know.
* If you have an interesting use-case or found a way to combine triggers and actions to achieve something intriguing and you think it's worth putting it on the examples page (https://server47.de/automation/examples.html), let me know.

Do you have an almost unlimited data plan and you never consume all your data? Lucky you! Unfortunately this app will be useless in this situation.

On the other hand: do you have a limited data plan and it has happened to you:
a) You always spend too much data on the first days of the period, and you have few left at the end?
or
b) You try not to spend too much data at the beginning of the period, and then you end with unused data?
or
c) You always wanted to know 'Did I spent too much already?' 'Am I above an average usage?'.

Then this app will (I hope) help you! 
It shows your data usage (bottom bar, how much you already used) with an ideal 'average data usage' (top bar, how much you would have used by downloading the same amount of bytes every second in the period). This way with just one look you can check if you are above or below the 'average data usage'.
 - If the top bar is longer than the bottom: Good! You can download a bit more and still have at the end of the period.
 - If the top bar is shorter than the bottom: Not good! You need to stop using too much data, otherwise you'll end with no more left.

Isn't this useful? I think it is, and that's why I (TrianguloY) published it. It doesn't contains ads, and it is absurdly lightweight, so give it a try.
If you have any suggestion or comment leave one or send an email.

DISCLAIMER!!!!
Please note that the current consumption is measured by your device and may differ with your company measurement. I can't take responsibility if the displayed data usage is wrong.


Permissions:
- PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS - Permission needed to get the current usage from the usage service. No other data is retrieved nor used.
More info here: https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/usage/NetworkStatsManager.html#querySummaryForDevice(int,%20java.lang.String,%20long,%20long)
- POST_NOTIFICATIONS - Permission needed to show a small message at the bottom of the screen (toast) when pressing the widget. The app does not send any standard notification.

It can collect information about food products, cosmetics books and music (CDs, Vinyls…).

Different barcodes formats are managed by the app :
• 2 dimensions bar codes: QR Code, Data Matrix, PDF 417, AZTEC
• 1 dimension bar codes: EAN 13, EAN 8, UPC A, UPC E, Code 128, Code 93, Code 39, Codabar, ITF

Collect information about a product during a scan :
• Food products with Open Food Facts
• Cosmetics with Open Beauty Facts
• Food products for pets with Open Pet Food Facts
• Books with Open Library
• Music CDs, Vinyls… with MusicBrainz

App features :
• Simply point your smartphone's camera to a barcode and instantly receive information about it. You can also scan barcodes through a picture in your smartphone.
• With a simple scan, read business cards, add new contacts, add new events to your agenda, open URL or even connect to Wi-Fi.
• Scan Food products barcodes to receive information about their composition thanks to the databases Open Food Facts and Open Beauty Facts.
• Search information about the product you scan, with a quick research on different websites such as Amazon or Fnac.
• Keep track of all your scanned barcodes with the history tool.
• Generate your own barcodes
• Customize the interface with different colors, with a light theme or a dark one. The interface is built with Material 3 and is compatible with Material You, allowing you to adjust colors based on your wallpaper for devices running on Android 12 or later.
• Texts are entirely translated in English, Arabic, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Russian, German, Turkish, Italian, Ukrainian, Polish, Dutch, Romanian and Chinese (Simplified and Traditional).

This app respects your privacy. It does not contain any trackers and does not collect any data.

It will probably not get any updates.

Read the information stored in barcodes or create QR-codes for sharing addresses, contacts or text between devices.

Book, product and web searches go to a Google server (depending on the choice of origin country), though a custom search button can be created in the settings e.g. duckduckgo.com/?q=%s or wikibooks.org/w/index.php?search=%s.

Supports following barcode types:

* UPC-A and UPC-E
* EAN-8 and EAN-13
* Code 39; 93; 128
* ITF
* Codabar
* RSS-14 (all variants)
* QR Code
* Data Matrix
* Aztec ('beta' quality)
* PDF 417 ('alpha' quality)

See the website for troubleshooting and explanations of the permissions. The app allows you to share contacts, apps, and bookmarks in a QR Code. This is why contacts permissions are needed. See ""Visit Developer Website"" below ( https://github.com/zxing/zxing/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions ).

If your device is not scanning, first try workarounds for device bugs in Settings. Enable all of them, and then try disabling one at a time to determine which is necessary. If this does not help, try clearing the device cache and settings from Android settings.

If these still do not work and you believe there is an app problem, send a message to the author with the following information. Messages without this information can't be acted on, so are ignored.

- Device type
- A basic description of what does not work: crashes? does not scan? looks strange?
- Acknowledgement that you tried the steps above first
- A device log capture from when it starts

An app for managing <strong>NewPipe</strong> databases.

<strong>BendyStraw</strong> imports [ NewPipeData-*.zip ] files and lets you:

<ul>
  <li>Open multiple [ zip ]s at the same time, so you can combine data from several devices</li>
  <li>[ Delete ] [ Copy ] [ Move ] [ Rename ] your custom playlists</li>
  <li>[ Delete ] [ Copy ] [ Move ] streams from one playlist to another</li>
  <li>[ Delete ] [ Copy ] [ Move ] channel subscriptions between databases</li>
  <li>[ Delete ] [ Copy ] [ Move ] remote (bookmarked) playlists</li>
  <li>Re-order playlists, sorting the streams by [ Title ], [ Channel ] or [ Length ] (just tap the column headings in the tables)</li>
  <li>Shuffle or reverse playlists</li>
  <li>Streams (audio/video) can be opened directly from <strong>BendyStraw</strong>, as the URLs are clickable
    <ul>
      <li>If you set video links (in your Android settings) to open in <strong>NewPipe</strong> you can make a split-screen view and jump around your playlists</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Export playlist as raw text, for example to be used with <a href=""https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp"">yt-dlp</a></li>
  <li><strong>New!</strong> Import playlists from JSON (the button to do this is hidden by default, go to the settings menu to show it)</li>
  <li><strong>New!</strong> Open as a temporary YouTube playlist in your browser (the button to do this is hidden by default, go to the settings menu to show it)</li>
  <li>Dark/light themes</li>
</ul>

After editing simply export a new [ zip ] file, then import it back into <strong>NewPipe</strong>.



## Note about Permissions

On Android 13+, <strong>BendyStraw</strong> asks for the <em>manage external storage</em> permission, here's why:

<ul>
  <li>
    A typical use-case for this app is to open several [ zip ] files, concurrently, from multiple locations including [ Download ] directories (these files would be, for example, multiple <strong>NewPipe</strong> exports from multiple devices, which you want to combine).
  </li>
  <li>
    Each [ zip ] is extracted so that its contained [ newpipe.db ] SQLite database can be read/written while you are editing.
  </li>
  <li>
    After editing, the extracted files are written back to a new [ zip ], and/or overwrite the original [ zip ]s.
  </li>
</ul>


<strong>I aim to minimise the permissions I request in everything I build</strong>. Android 13 introduced changes to make doing what I decribed above difficult. I explored alternative methods requiring fewer permissions and felt that it compromised the user experience for my (as the app's first user) typical usage, making it more complicated and annoying.


I treat users as responsible human beings, so give you this info to allow you to make an informed choice. If you are not happy with this, you can:

<ul>
  <li>Choose not to grant the permission, and uninstall the app.</li>
  <li>
    Check the source code to see that I'm not doing anything nefarious, or ask somebody to check it for you (at time of writing, everything related to reading/writing files is in [ /lib/file_manager_widget.dart ]).
  </li>
  <li>
    Build the app yourself from the source using <strong>Flutter</strong>.
  </li>
</ul>

This application aims to create a unified internet quick-settings tile, which is actually useful (I'm looking at you, Android 12). Next to this, separate Wi-Fi and mobile data tiles are also available if you just want to go back to the behaviour of Android 11 or lower.

Tapping the new unified internet tile will simply toggle between Wi-Fi and mobile data, which is exactly what I want it to do most of the time. This reduces the amount of taps needed from 3 (tap tile, disable wifi, enable data) to just 1 quick tap. In situations where you still want more control, long pressing the tile will redirect you to the relevant settings page.

For students, by students.","Better Schedule is a faster app for the Bakaláři schedule. For students, by students.

I'm a student who got tired of waiting for the official Bakaláři app to load my schedule on a slow school wifi. That's why I created this app. Better schedule remembers your schedule even without internet connection so it can be shown instantly. Simple interface makes it easy to switch between weeks and thanks to persistent notification you don't even need to open the app!

Main features:
• Very fast schedule loading — Combines offline and online data to display schedule within a second.
• Seamless offline mode — Everything is cached in the background so that schedule can be shown even when you are offline.
• Persistent notification — You don't have to open the app to see next lesson any more.
• Beautiful widget — The next lesson or overview of the entire day always on your home screen.
• Simple interface — Easy switching between weeks.
• Themes — light, dark or your very own custom theme.
• Free and open source software — No ads, no spying, free, forever.

Not a fan of the yellow colour? You can change it in the app or use one of the themes at https://vitskalicky.gitlab.io/lepsi-rozvrh/motivy/

The entire app is a free/libre and open source software. If you want to suggest an enhancement, have a look on how it works, or you can code and want to improve the app, head over to GitLab https://gitlab.com/vitSkalicky/lepsi-rozvrh

It is a 700-verse text in Sanskrit which comprises chapters 23 through 40 in the Bhishma-Parva section of the Mahabharata.
The Bhagavad Gita is a dialogue between Arjuna, a supernaturally gifted warrior and his guide and charioteer Lord Krishna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra. As both armies stand ready for the battle, the mighty warrior Arjuna, on observing the warriors on both sides becomes overwhelmed with grief and compassion due to the fear of losing his relatives and friends and the consequent sins attributed to killing his own relatives. So, he surrenders to Lord Krishna, seeking a solution. Thus, follows the wisdom of the Bhagavad Gita. Over 18 chapters, the Bhagavad Gita packs an intense analysis of life, emotions and ambitions, discussion of various types of yoga, including Jnana, Bhakti, Karma and Raja, the difference between Self and the material body as well as the revelation of the Ultimate Purpose of Life.

Being close to God is the desire of many people. Reading in His Word is a particularly suitable possibility for it. For some time, there have also been practical apps with various Bible translations for reading and studying, reading schedules, prayers and much more.

An old custom is the so-called “Bibelstechen” (Bible drawing), in which the Bible is simply opened and a verse or chapter is read at the Bible passage that has been struck in this way.

This app is designed to offer a practical alternative for this kind of Bible drawing:
If you touch onto the ""Touch me"" button, a book with chapter indication appears.
To read this drawn Bible chapter you can use a Bible app of your choice or read it in your paper Bible.

The ""Bibel-Kapitel-Losung"" (Bible chapter drawing) app is costless and advertising-free, it does not require access rights, works offline, does not require registration and can be used as often as desired.

<li>A translation team can work with Bibledit via the Internet without installing anything. We call this the Cloud version. But for most translation team members, it will be better to install Bibledit locally. This is called the Client version. The Client version saves editing changes made by each team member to his/her device, and when they have an connection, their work will automatically be saved to the Cloud.</li>
<li>Many excellent and scholarly translation resources available in Bibledit. And one can view translation resources while editing a translation on the same screen.</li>
<li>Bibledit can port changes in a Bible text over to a local instance of Paratext. I think many translation team leaders will want to do this. But the opposite is also possible: Bibledit can receive Bible texts from Paratext.</li>
<li>Bibledit has many powerful export options. These include creating web-ready HTML files, beautifully formatted OpenOffice files (which then can easily be turned into PDF files), and Sword modules for Bible-reading applications on all smart devices.</li>

This app was created to remember and manage events in a simple and effective way.
The app contains some basic personalization options and an introduction, plus some new resources like animated vector drawables and the automatic dark/light theme. Support and updates are guaranteed!
  

<h2><b>Why should i use Birday? 😕</b></h2>
Well, i'll tell you 3 main reasons:
<ul>
    <li> It can help you to remember every birthday in the moment you prefer! </li>
    <li> It will cost just a few MB of storage! </li>
    <li> It's beautiful, full of animations and simple to use! </li>
</ul>

Birday allows you to import the events directly from your contacts or calendar, with a simple favorite system and a set of stats to discover!
if you're starting to develop apps and you need an app to look at, to find some inspiration and tricks: click on the Github link, and the Birday source code is served!
  

<h2><b>Features 🎂</b></h2>
<ul>
    <li> Simple events timeline, with the next date and the name of each person </li>
    <li> Favorite system, to aggregate your favorite events and see more information </li>
    <li> Overview screen and a lot of basic and advanced settings </li>
    <li> Import birthdays from contacts or calendar with basic duplicate detection </li>
    <li> Backup your events easily, in native, csv or json format
    <li> 30+ language available. If you don't see your language, you can translate the app yourself! </li>
    <li> Easily delete, modify or share every event </li>
    <li> Each favorite event has an handy note field </li>
    <li> Customizable notification the day of the event, and additional notification(s)! </li>
    <li> Light, dark and black Amoled theme </li>
    <li> Selectable accent and Monet accent (12 choices) </li>
    <li> Hide and unhide the top cards for maximum ui flexibility </li>
    <li> A quick search bar and type selector! </li>
    <li> 2 customizable widgets </li>
    <li> First introduction and beautiful animations including an animated notification icon </li>
    <li> Simple and precise ui, following the material guidelines </li>
</ul>

Please note: the notification system relies on the Android OS resources, thus some manufacturers may cause malfunctions. The reason is that some Xiaomi, Huawei and Oneplus devices kill the apps instead of simply closing it, or block the automatic startup of the app process. I can't fix this, but you can find more information on dontkillmyapp.com.

A little pastime that is not about speed. With new multi-player mode ""Stone Wars""!

Different game pieces are to be inserted in a 10 x 10 large playing field. Horizontal rows or vertical columns are removed as soon as they are full. As the game progresses, more tile shapes are added again and again. Game pieces can be rotated by tapping. What high score will you achieve?

Parking: A game piece can be parked in the gray field. But be careful! As soon as no more pieces can be inserted in the playing field or in the parking area, the game is over! So play the parked game piece as quickly as possible!

Rotate the game piece by tapping it.

Gravitation: If horizontal rows are cleared in the lower playing field, the upper part slides down.

Points system:
 - Insert: number of blocks on the piece
 - Clear row: 10 points
 - clear away several rows at once: bonus points
 - The playing field has only 1 block left or is empty: extra bonus! After that the playing field must be filled 40%.
 - 20 connected pieces of one color result in a further extra bonus.
 - Star block gives 200 bonus points!

Block Puzzle Stone Wars

While the old game (with randomly generated game pieces) has been retained, a new multi-player mode has been added: Stone Wars. You are on a spaceship and you have to liberate the galaxy. In the distant future, conflicts will be resolved by playing Block Puzzle. Navigate through a star cluster of tens of planets at lightning speed thanks to the spur drive. Little by little, the space map is revealed. The planets are of different sizes and have different gravity, which affects the game. The liberation takes place through the Block Puzzle Classic Game or through the new Cleaner Game.
In the Cleaner Game, you win by clearing the playing field. However, if your enemy needs fewer moves, he is the liberator of the planet. In the Classic Game, however, a high score counts. A minimum liberation score (MLS) must be achieved in the Classic Game. In some cleaner games, a certain number of moves may not be exceeded (XLM).

Since the epochal data breach 200 years ago, a data processing system is no longer allowed to send or receive data. Therefore, you have to exchange your score with your friends or enemies via another app (e.g. WhatsApp). Enter your player name, which is as unique as possible, and copy the score of the current quadrant in the data exchange. Then go to WhatsApp, for example, and add the game status there. The recipient can then copy this saved game and paste it into the Stone Wars data exchange. You then take over all planets in his game where you are better than him. Will he be able to drive you out again?

Stone Wars works in such a way that you first select a planet in the navigation and click Select. Then tap back on the phone and start the liberation. All game pieces are predefined in terms of type and order.

Our program is and will remain free and ad-free. There will be no in-app purchases. It does not require any phone rights and is played completely offline.

Android 7.0 introduced better built-in support for blocking numbers so this app is probably less useful on versions 7+.

Block6 is free and open source on Github at https://github.com/travistynes/block6. Feel free to send feedback, pull requests, or use the code for your own purpose.

It can be seamlessly switched between these controllers, and for application rules, you can export and import them. Additionally, it is compatible with backup files generated by MyAndroidTools, and you can effortlessly convert them to Intent Firewall rules. The application also has the potential to be extended in the future.

<h3>Advantages</h3>

1. Lightweight, don't burden the system
2. Easy to use
3. Supports multiple control types

<h3>Introduction to different component controllers</h3>
<h4>Package Manager</h4>
The Android system provides a tool called PackageManager, which is used for managing installed applications or obtaining information about them. One of its methods, ```setComponentEnabledSetting(ComponentName, int, int)```, allows an application to control the state of its own components. If attempting to use this method to control components in other applications, a signature permission is required, or the call will fail.

Fortunately, Android provides another tool called ""pm"" that allows users to control component states in command-line mode. However, the ""pm"" tool requires root permission to run. The following command can be used to disable a specific package or component:

```
pm disable [PackageName/ComponmentName]
```

Whether using PackageManager in the code or ""pm"" in command-line mode, the configurations will be written to ```/data/system/users/0/package_restrictions.xml```.

<h4>Intent Firewall Mode</h4>
Intent Firewall was introduced in Android 4.4.2 (API 19) and is still effective in the latest Android systems. It is integrated into the Android Framework to filter the intents sent by applications or systems.

<h5>What Intent Firewall can do</h5>
Each intent sent by an application is filtered by the Intent Firewall, with rules stored in XML files. The Intent Firewall updates rules immediately if changes occur in the configuration file.

<h5>Limitations of Intent Firewall</h5>
Only system applications can read and write the directory where the configuration file is stored, and third-party applications do not have permission to access it.

<h5>Differences between Intent Firewall and Package Manager</h5>
Intent Firewall, indeed it is a firewall, it has no impact on component status. The application detects the component is on, but it just cannot start the component.

For the components disabled by PackageManager, if an application starts it, an exception will be thrown. Developers can catch this exception to know whether the component is disabled or not, so they could re-enable this component. That's the reason why the components will be enabled unexpectedly. If you are using an Intent Firewall controller, there will be no problems.

<h3>UI</h3>
The app was designed using Material 3 guidelines.
Huge thanks to our UI designer: @COPtimer (https://github.com/COPtimer)

The Screens and UI elements are built entirely using Jetpack Compose.

The app has two themes:

Dynamic color - uses colors based on the user's current color theme (if supported)

Default theme - uses predefined colors when dynamic color is not supported

Each theme also supports dark mode.",1

BluePass extracts two factor authentication codes (2FA) from SMS and sends them to a paired device via Bluetooth RFCOMM. A Qt based companion app <a href=""https://github.com/boon-code/bluepass-server"">bluepass-server</a> will receive the 2FA codes and provide them via the system clipboard.


<b>Use Case</b>

The company I work for is relying on third party services that require to authenticate using 2FA. The second factor is an SMS to your mobile phone. This app was built for convenience, to avoid having to unlock your phone, find the message and then type the received code on the PC.

It is not about the time saved, it's about getting rid of robot tasks.


<b>Setup</b>

You have to configure parameters to match the sender of the SMS and parse the code from the messages sent to you. Currently, regular expressions are used for this task. However, a very basic setup will be provided below.

<i>Regular expression for sender</i> has to be set to a regular expression that matches all the senders of SMS (as they appear in your chat application). Multiple numbers and names can be provided:
<ul>
    <li>To match <i>CompanyA</i>, you might simply put<i>CompanyA</i> into the box</li>
    <li>To match <i>CompanyA</i> and <i>12345678</i>, write <i>(CompanyA|12345678)</i></li>
</ul>

<i>Regular expression to filter the content</i> has to be set to a regular expression that matches the messages you want to catch. Additionally, it has to define one group to extract the actual code that has to be sent to the PC.
<ul>
    <li>To match any number, you can use <i>[^\d]*(\d+).*</i></li>
    <li>To match a code only with 6 digits, use: <i>.*(\d{6}).*</i></li>
</ul>

... as the process of defining a proper regular expression is not that easy, there is another text box <i>Test message</i>. You can paste here the content of the SMS thatyou want to match and adjust the regular expression until it gets parsed correctly.

The last step of the configuration is to pair with the bluetooth adapter of your PC and configure the adapter to be used.


<b>Operation</b>

<ul>
    <li>Whenever your mobile phone receives an SMS (and the settings above are configured), this app will try to match the sender and content. If one of the two doesn't match, the message will not be processed any further.</li>
    <li>If the 2FA code could be extracted, a foreground service will be started (status bar) and the app tries to connect to the configured Bluetooth adapter and sends the code. It retries for some amount of time and reports the status in the status bar. <u>Note</u>: The notification in the status bar doesn't automatically disappear. However, this doesn't consume any resources and can be removed using the <i>Stop</i> button.</li>
    <li> If the code is required on the mobile phone, it can be copied using the <i>Copy last</i> button.</li>
</ul>


<b>Protocol</b>

The communication is based on very simple primitives using an RFCOMM channel. The UUID for the service is <i>e4d56fb3-b86d-4572-9b0d-44d483eb1eee</i>. Extracted codes are sent as text (over a secure Bluetooth connection) terminated with a new line character. Therefore, codes may not contain any new line characters.


<b>Future</b>

<ul>
    <li>The protocol will be changed to something more sophisticated and extensible</li>
    <li>Configuration of the sender should be done through contact providers and not use regular expressions</li>
    <li>Allow to use this app to share text / files with the PC</li>

It is just BookWyrm put into a webview element, nothing special – but it adds some convenience on top:

* bookwyrm links can be made to open with the app (e.g. clicking on the link to someone's userprofile will open that from your own bookwyrm instance)
* thanks to that, you can immediately follow them easily if you want.
* it lets you easily return to your own home timeline when viewing something like posts, on another bookwyrm instance, because the 'back' button is then modified for that.
* You can also search for books by scanning the ISBN, no matter what instance of Bookwyrm you use.

<b>This application is <u>not</u> an official client!</b> (An official client does not exist yet, as far as I know)

The ISBN scanning feature is created with the zxing-android-embedded library.

Well I for sure
understand this problem to the heart. But fear no more, as BootBoi is here to save you from the gruesome task of standing up
and pushing a button.

BootBoi features remote power on / power off / reboot for as many remote machines as you can imagine with the
combined power of SSH and Wake On Lan.

Preparing your Remote Machine
* Before you can use BootBoi with your remote machines, you have to prepare them for **remote** rebooting and powering them on/off.

Power On
* To power a remote device on, BootBoi uses <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wake-on-LAN"">Wake On Lan</a>.
* This needs to be enabled in the BIOS of the machine you want to power on, read more <a href=""https://www.lifewire.com/wake-on-lan-4149800"">here</a>.

Power Off / Reboot
* BootBoi uses <a href=""https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell"">SSH</a> to execute whoami, poweroff and reboot on the remote machine.
* So make sure that
    * Those binaries are available and in $PATH
    * The SSH user has sudo access to whoami, poweroff and reboot
        * Either by allowing the user sudo access only to those binaries via the <a href=""https://linux.die.net/man/5/sudoers"">sudoers file</a> (recommended)
            * E.g. `echo ""my_ssh_user ALL=(ALL) /sbin/reboot,/sbin/poweroff,/usr/bin/whoami"" >> /etc/local/sudoers`
        * Or by using root as SSH user in BootBoi

Imagine this scenario: You have 45 minutes time to go for a walk, so you should go back after the half of the time. So, set the timer duration to 45 minutes, define a break after the half of the time and start the timer. Now you get a notification (audio signal, vibration, device notification) when the half of the time is reached, AND of course when the complete time is reached.

Other scenarios could be to get notified every quarter of a duration to keep a feeling of the passing and remaining time. Or to get notifications short before the end of the duration.

The notifications are encoded in patterns of audio beeps and/or vibrations to express the reached in-between break. The pattern is very simple: a short beep means ""1"", a long beeeeep means ""5"". So, e.g. ""beeeeep beep"" means ""6"". All signals are prefixed with a short ""bepbep"" sequence to attract attention.

With the audio and vibration patterns you can even get notified about the timer progress without pulling your phone out of the pocket and looking on it. This is also very handy during workouts.

<b>Features:</b>
 - up to 20 notifications (""breaks"") during a timer run 
 - acoustic and haptic feedback 
 - intuitive patterns to recognise current reached break
 - two different timer modes, ""Timer"" and ""Clock""
 - different ""break"" presets
 - storing own presets
 - different color schemes

<p>
This is a roguelite twist on the original Breakout/Arkanoid formula.
The goal is to catch as many coins as possible during 7 levels.
Coins appear when you break bricks.
They fly around, bounce and roll, and you need to catch them with your puck.
Your ""combo"" is the number of coins spawned when a brick breaks, it is displayed on your puck.
Your score is displayed in the top right corner of the screen.
</p>

<p>
At the end of each level, you get to pick an upgrade from a random selection, vampire-survivor style.
Many upgrades impact your ""combo"". Upgrades apply to the whole run and can synergize.
For example, ""hot start"" increases your combo greatly at the start of each level, but makes it tick down rapidly.
If you combine it with ""+1 ball"", ""piercing"" and ""bricks become bombs"", you'll clear levels so fast that the combo
will still be high when the fireworks are over and your puck will be showered by coins.
</p>

<p>What decides how the ball flies away is only the position of the puck hit.
The puck speed and incoming angle have no impact.
You must delete all bricks to progress to the next level, and never drop the ball.
</p>

<p>
After clearing a level, you'll be able to pick upgrades among a small selection presented to you.
They'll apply until the end of the run.
A normal run lasts 7 levels, after which your score is recorded, and you can start again.
</p>

<p>
Each run is different, the levels and upgrades you see will change every time, and new ones get added to the pool
when you progress in the game.
</p>

<p>
The app should work offline and perform well even on low-end devices.
It's very lean and does not take much storage space (Roughly 0.1MB).
If the app stutters, turn on ""fast mode"" in the settings to render a simplified view that should be faster.
</p>

<p>
There's also an easy mode for kids (slower ball) and a color-blind mode (no color related game mechanics).

By play of Market Action cards, strategically manipulate prices to your advantage and to the downfall of your opponents. Win by having the most money in cash and stocks after the last card has been played. But be careful: if all of your remaining stock holdings crash, it is possible to be eliminated before the game is even over.

Originally published in 1961 as Broker by the Spencer-Murray Corporation of Swarthmore, Pennsylvania.

The original box is white, with lettering and logo in black, very basic, drab, and uninspiring. Yet this obscure title was quite a gem considering the limitation of games to choose from during its day.

In 1967 it was re-published by the German firm Otto Maier Verlag, which is the ancestor of Ravensburger Spieleverlag GmbH Verlag. Numerous re-publications followed (1972, 1977 and others) including at least one which gave the rules in German, English and Italian. It was also published in the Ravensburger Casino Series.
Components list for these editions are as follows: 160 stock certificates, 68 Market Action cards, 4 price markers, play money, stock price board.

The 1983 (9th edition) by Ravensburger Spieleverlag GmbH changes the title slightly to Börsenspiel instead of Das Börsenspiel and the original rules heavily. Although this set is well-designed and much nicer on the eyes, the bland original version featured larger (regular card deck) size action cards. An extra set of 18 ""risk"" cards replacing 18 market cards had been added and they act as event cards that immediately effect changes in the market. They cause the unfortunate player who draws one to play it instead of a market card, a chaotic effect that some players will not like. Android version was implemented by Martin Kostadinov. It is school project for finish 12 grade.

Durch die Verwendung hochkomplexer mathematischer Formeln wird das Zusammenzählen noch vereinfacht und für den typischen Schnapsenkönig digitalisiert. Auch wenn du Bummerl über Bummerl beim Schnapsen / Schnopsen verlierst, mit dieser App wirst du zum Kaiser auserkoren.

Was kann die App dir bieten?
* Du solltest dir lieber fragen was kann ICH für die App machen?
* Bist du überhaupt würdig solch eine revolutionäre Technologie anzuwenden?

Welche Spiele werden unterstützt?
* 2er, 3er und 4er Schnapser

Nein, ich meine welche Spiele wie zB Gang, Ring werden unterstützt?
* Jo tua di besser artikulieren
* Der echte Bauernschnapser wird ja nicht wie in diesen experimentellen sinnfreien Varianten mit Bettler und 10er Gang gespielt, aber für euch Städtler mach ma eine Ausnahme:
* Bettler, Schnapser, Gang/Ring, 10er Gang, Bauer, Foabnlandla/Farbenringerl, Herrenbauer

Ist es nicht einfacher einen Editor zu öffnen und dort mitzuschreiben?
* Hör auf mit diesen deppaten Fragen und lad endlich die App herunter!

This makes it easier to transfer specific photos to a computer, e.g. via USB cable (MTP protocol).

Either keep photos inside the camera folder tree or move or copy them to a separate directory. This can also used as a simple backup method.

Up to three levels are supported: year, month and day. The sorting can be reverted, i.e. all photos can be moved back to the base directory (but not back to the camera directory in case a destination directory is specified).

On the demand a file name prefix like ""IMG_"" or ""PXL_"" can be appended instead or completely removed. Note that this operation is not revertible.

The program does not read metadata (EXIF) from the photo files, instead it uses the data information encoded in the filenames.

To meet Google's restrictive policy, the Play Store variant of the program must use Google's proprietary Storage Access Framework when running on Android 11 or newer. As a consequence, file operations are extremely slow. This restriction partially exists also for older Android versions and not at all for the F-Droid version of the program. In this case standard file access calls can be activated alternatively, which accelerate the file operations with a factor of approximately 90 (!).",1

With <i>CameraFileCopy</i> it is possible to receive data over the camera as a one-way data channel. It does not use any antennas (wifi, bluetooth, nfc, ...) or other tricks. Notably, this means it works just as well in airplane mode.

The app reads animated <a href='https://github.com/sz3/libcimbar' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>cimbar codes</a>. Nearly all the interesting logic is from libcimbar – included via a git subtree. The sender component of cfc is a cimbar encoder -- such as <a href='https://cimbar.org/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>cimbar.org</a>. Navigate to that website (or use libcimbar's <code>cimbar_send</code> to generate barcodes natively), open a file to initialize the cimbar stream, and point the app+camera at the animated barcode.

This API has since been adopted by popular apps such as Snapchat.

CaptureSposed is an Xposed module that effectively disables this API as well as the screen recording detection API added in Android 15.

<b>⚠️ WARNING:</b> CaptureSposed is intended for rooted devices running Android 14 or newer and requires Xposed. The required Xposed variant to use is LSPosed. Other Xposed variants will not work. This module cannot be guaranteed to work on all devices. In the worst case, it can cause a bootloop. Use at your own risk. Additionally, this module does not protect against screenshot detection from apps that use the pre-Android 14 approach of using file system listeners to detect screenshots (<a href='https://abangfadli.medium.com/shotwatch-android-screenshot-detector-library-6a75d7242109'>ref 1</a>, <a href='https://viveksb007.wordpress.com/2017/11/10/how-snapchat-detects-when-screenshot-is-taken-hypothesis/'>ref 2</a>).

To use CaptureSposed:

1. Install LSposed. This requires your device to be rooted.
2. Install CaptureSposed.
3. Grant root access to CaptureSposed.
4. Activate the CaptureSposed module in the LSposed user interface.
5. Reboot your device and sign in.
6. Open the CaptureSposed app and attempt to take a screenshot and make a screen recording of it. If the screenshot and screen recording is not detected, then the module is working as intended.

What is it?
-----------
I think we can do better than the Official Casio G-Shock App!
This app provides the following extra features:

- Sets watch's reminders from Google Calendar
- Automatically sets correct timezone when travelling
- Use your watch to trigger actions on your phone remotely
- Allows you to set when auto-time adjustment will run
- Auto-configure most watch settings from phone's configuration
- Phone's alarms can be synced with watch's alarms
- Super fast connection time: 3.5 seconds vs 12 seconds for the official app

Supported Watches
-----------------
The app will try to connect and adapt to any Casio watch that wants to connect to it (not just G-Shock). Here are some watches which are reported to work with the app:

- G(M)W-5600
- G(M)W-5000
- GA-B2100
- GA-B001-1AER
- GST-B500
- GST-B200
- MSG-B100
- G-B001
- GBD-H1000 (Partial support)
- MRG-B5000
- GCW-B5000
- GG-B100
- Edifice ECB-30
- ECB-10
- ECB-20
- Most Edifice watches
- Most Protrek models
- ABL-100WE

General
-------
The app works by sending commands to the watch via Bluetooth (BLE). The watch data is not persisted on the phone but is read from the watch each time a connection is established. Any changes on the app are sent back to the watch only when the Send to Watch button is pressed.

Setting Time
------------
The local time can be set from the main screen by pressing the Send to Watch button next to the current time display. The app uses your current location to get the local time. You can then set the watch time accordingly, without having to change your World Time selection on the watch. This screen also shows your Home Time location and battery level.

Alarms
------
The B5600/B5000 watches have 5 alarms and a Signal or chime setting. They are first read from the watch and displayed in the app. The alarms can be updated by pressing on the time display of each alarm. A dialog will appear which allows you to select the time. Once the alarms have been set, you can send them to the watch or send them to the Alarm Clock app on the phone.

Events
------
This screen displays events from your Google Calendar and allows you to send these events to your watch's reminders. Ensure that your phone is set to auto-sync with your Google Account. Without this setting, events added to your phone will not sync with your Google account and will not appear in the app.

Event Types and Compatibility
-----------------------------
Google Calendar supports various types of events:
- One-time events: Single occurrences.
- Repeating events: Daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, or complex patterns (e.g., ""every second Thursday of the month"").
- Count events: Limited repetitions, such as ""repeat 12 times every Monday.""

While the app does its best to adapt calendar events to the watch, some limitations exist:
- Not Supported: Daily events and complex patterns (e.g., ""every second Thursday of the month"").
- Count Events: Simulated on the watch using a start and end date, adjusted to match the event's start time, frequency, and count.

Events that cannot be adapted will appear as Incompatible. Only future events and ongoing recurring events are displayed.

Watch-Specific Behavior
----------l-------------
The watch only supports all-day reminders. For Google Calendar events with a specific time, the app will convert them into all-day reminders on the watch while still retaining their date.

Actions
-------
The selected actions are run when the user short-presses the lower-right watch button from disconnected mode (initial screen). Using these actions, the watch acts like a remote control for your phone.

Settings
--------
This screen allows you to set up the watch's settings. You can auto prefill the values using information from your phone.

Where are my World Cities?
--------------------------
Using an app to manually swap between Home Time and World Time is a bit silly. Your phone already knows where you are. When setting time, this app will also",1

It uses peer-to-peer technology to deliver websites to your phone and caches popular content with cooperating peers. Ceno can be used to bypass Internet censorship and help others retrieve blocked pages.

Say NO to censorship! Install Ceno Browser today and be prepared for the next time you get 🔌 unplugged. 

🚫🌴 <strong>Resilient.</strong>
Ceno is designed with internet shutdown scenarios in mind. Websites are shared by a global network of peers, and stored in a distributed cache for availability when traditional networks are blocked or go down.

🔓👀 <strong>Unlock the web.</strong>
Access any website. Frequently requested content is cached on the network  and cannot be forcibly removed. 

💲🌐 <strong>Reduce Data Costs.</strong>
By routing user traffic through peer-to-peer networks, Ceno Browser incurs less data costs while still providing users with circumvention capability.

📖👐  <strong>Free and open source.</strong>
Ceno Browser is powered by Ouinet, an open source library enabling third party developers to incorporate the Ceno network into their apps for peer-to-peer connectivity.

<strong>Important:</strong> Ceno has two modes of operation - public and personal. You can easily toggle between them. Public mode offers the best connectivity but the least privacy - websites that you visit or share are recorded in a publicly accessible registry (BitTorrent). Private mode eliminates this record but may be slower and less efficient at retrieving content. <strong>See the <a href=""https://censorship.no/user-manual"">User Manual</a> for more details on Ceno usage. </strong>

<strong>About eQualit.ie</strong>
eQualit.ie develops open and reusable systems with a focus on privacy, online security, and information management. Our goal is to create accessible technology and improve the skill-set needed for defending human rights and freedoms in the digital age.

Play against an AI or each other!,"Privacy Friendly Checkers is a strategy board game for two players. The objective of the game is to either capture all opposing game pieces by jumping over them or by creating a situation in which the opponent cannot make a move anymore due to being blocked.

Privacy Friendly Checkers features two game modes: one game mode allows playing versus a computer-controlled opponent and the second game mode is for two human-controlled players using the same device. The game board consists of 8x8 squares and each player starts with 12 game pieces. The white player begins and then both players alternate taking turns. Furthermore, color-highlighting is used to graphically emphasize which moves are allowed to be made and the interface displays which game pieces have already been captured so the game progress can be tracked more easily. Additionally, the app automatically saves the last game status so it is possible to resume a previously started game at a later time.

How does Privacy Friendly Checkers differ from other similar apps?

1) No permissions

Privacy Friendly Dame does not require any permissions.

2) No advertisement

Moreover, Privacy Friendly Dame completely relinquishes advertisement. Many other apps in the Google Play Store display advertisement and therefore might violate the users privacy, shorten battery life or use mobile data.

Privacy Friendly Checkers is part of the Privacy Friendly Apps group developed by the research group SECUSO at Karlsuhe Institute of Technology. More information at: https://secuso.org/pfa

Because the voice is generated in real-time, it has high performance requirements.

The FastSpeech model works fast but the generated voice has poor anthropomorphic effect. It works well on a middle-end device. The Tacotron has high performance requirements. Though the overall effect is better, the speed is very slow. Therefore it's bundled only for test and can't be used in practice.

The attackers in this game are represented as bits and bytes. To defend the cpu against them, the player builds chips in designated slots. These ""towers"" deal damage by operations such as subtraction, right shift, bitwise and, etc. As usual in these games, the chips can be upgraded in strength.

The game features ""heroes of the information age"": persons that had great influence on the development of modern computers. They come with a short biography und provide global bonuses that make the game considerably easier.

Currently, there are more than 25 heroes and heroines. The game comes with 32 predefined levels, but it has also an ""endless"" mode with randomly generated levels. Supported languages are English, French, and German.

It provides a configurable set of timers for the exercises and the rest phases as well as multiple other features.

Workout Timer
After configuring the set of timers in the main menu you can start the workout routine by pressing the start button. The workout view has animations and sound output features which can be turned on and off inside the settings menu.

Motivation Alert
The app can show you motivation alerts to remind you of planned workout sessions. You can define the time of day and the notification texts inside the settings menu.

Block Periodization
When scheduling the timers you may also choose the block periodization feature. This feature allows you to configure longer, separate breaks in between the exercises. This way the workout can be split into multiple high intensity workout cycles.

Workout History
The app can collect statistics about your performed workout sessions. The collected data comprises of the time spend working out and the calories burnt while exercising. The accuracy of the calories calculation can be improved by configuring the necessary user data in the settings menu. The collection of this data can be deleted as well as turned on and off inside the settings menu.

Exercise Sets
The app allows you to create your own Exercise Sets for the circuit training. Therefore you can combine your own exercises to exercise sets. The image assigned to an exercise is displayed during the workout. In addition, the exercise sets can be repeated during a workout. For this you can set the number of rounds before starting the workout.


How does Privacy Friendly Circuit Trainer differ from other similar apps?

1. No permissions
Privacy Friendly Circuit Trainer does not require any permissions. The selection of images is done by a task to the gallery so the app does not have any access to the device's storage without the user's control and interaction.

2. No advertisement
Many other free apps in the Google Play Store dazzle annoying advertising and also shortens battery life.

Privacy Friendly Circuit Training is part of the Privacy Friendly Apps group developed by the research group SECUSO at Technische Universität Darmstadt. More information at: https://secuso.org/pfa

In the undesired event that you test positive for COVID-19, Contact Diary is a place where to quickly find who you must warn about the situation.

<b>How it works</b>
Every day Contact Diary will prompt you to insert the events you have attended and the people you have been with during the day. Through some simple forms you will be able to store the essential information about your contacts, in case you need to retrieve it. Just that. Simple, right? ;)

<b>Features</b>
<ul>
<li> Configurable notification time, so the prompt does not interfere with your daily workflow.</li>
<li> Show only potentially risky contacts.</li>
<li> Automatic removal of entries older than 15 days.</li>
<li> Export your latest contacts to a CSV file that you can share with the authorities.</li>
<li> JUST ONE PERMISSION, that needed for the app being able to notify you after device restarts. Nothing else.</li>
<li> In particular, NO INTERNET permission. The information entered is yours, and it never leaves your device.</li>
</ul>

<b>FAQ</b>
- Wait, isn't this what Governments' contact tracing apps are doing?
No. The goals of Governments' contact tracing apps and of Contact Diary are inherently different. Governments' contact tracing apps <em>notify you</em> when you have been at risk, and Contact Diary serves to remember who <em>you must notify</em> if you test positive.

- Is this app BETTER than Governments' contact tracing apps?
No. Governments' contact tracing apps may account for contacts that you may not be aware of, like the person sitting in a neighboring table at a restaurant, or that other person using the same bus to go to work. Contact Diary IS NOT A REPLACEMENT TO GOVERNMENTS' CONTACT TRACING APPS.

- Is this app WORSE than Governments' contact tracing apps?
No. Government's contact tracing apps crucially rely on all persons interacting to have the app in order to do proper notifications. With Contact Diary, you just need yourself to keep track, and you can easily notify people (or places) that do not use conventional contact tracing apps.

- Will this app share the information I input?
NO. The app has no permissions, so there is no way that it can connect to the internet. The information you insert will never leave your device. Even more, entries in the diary are automatically eliminated when they become older than 15 days.

Note this is a one way import from your authorative CSV file. Contacts are imported onto a new account ""My Contacts""|owned by the app. If you uninstall the app this account and contacts contained within it will be deleted. The idea is you leave the app on the phone, it does not run or use any resources when not being used. And use the app again to reimport the CSV when it changes. It is also recommended that you take backups and exports, and save outide the app.

With built-in support for images, group chats and e2e encryption.

Design principles:

* Be as beautiful and easy to use as possible without sacrificing security or privacy
* Rely on existing, well established protocols
* Do not require a Google Account or specifically Google Cloud Messaging (GCM)
* Require as few permissions as possible

Features:

* End-to-end encryption with either <a href=""http://conversations.im/omemo/"">OMEMO</a> or <a href=""http://openpgp.org/about/"">OpenPGP</a>
* Sending and receiving images
* Encrypted audio and video calls (DTLS-SRTP)
* Intuitive UI that follows Android Design guidelines
* Pictures / Avatars for your Contacts
* Syncs with desktop client
* Conferences (with support for bookmarks)
* Address book integration
* Multiple accounts / unified inbox
* Very low impact on battery life

Conversations makes it very easy to create an account on the free conversations.im server. However Conversations will work with any other XMPP server as well. A lot of XMPP servers are run by volunteers and are free of charge.

XMPP Features:

Conversations works with every XMPP server out there. However XMPP is an extensible protocol. These extensions are standardized as well in so called XEP’s. Conversations supports a couple of those to make the overall user experience better. There is a chance that your current XMPP server does not support these extensions. Therefore to get the most out of Conversations you should consider either switching to an XMPP server that does or - even better - run your own XMPP server for you and your friends.

These XEPs are - as of now:

* XEP-0065: SOCKS5 Bytestreams (or mod_proxy65). Will be used to transfer files if both parties are behind a firewall or NAT.
* XEP-0163: Personal Eventing Protocol for avatars
* XEP-0191: Blocking command lets you blacklist spammers or block contacts without removing them from your roster.
* XEP-0198: Stream Management allows XMPP to survive small network outages and changes of the underlying TCP connection.
* XEP-0280: Message Carbons which automatically syncs the messages you send to your desktop client and thus allows you to switch seamlessly from your mobile client to your desktop client and back within one conversation.
* XEP-0237: Roster Versioning mainly to save bandwidth on poor mobile connections
* XEP-0313: Message Archive Management synchronize message history with the server. Catch up with messages that were sent while Conversations was offline.
* XEP-0352: Client State Indication lets the server know whether or not Conversations is in the background. Allows the server to save bandwidth by withholding unimportant packages.
* XEP-0363: HTTP File Upload allows you to share files in conferences and with offline contacts. Requires an additional component on your server.

- Attest the state of a Linux computer

When your computer is in a trustworthy state, you can generate a private key hidden in the TPM2 of your computer. This private key can be sealed with the current state of the computer (PCRs). Then the computer can only sign a message with this key when it is in the correct state according to the PCRs. For example, you can seal the key against the secure boot state (PCR7). If your computer is booting an operating system signed by another vendor, the TPM2 cannot unseal the private key. So if your computer can generate a correct signature, it is in this known state. You can create a sealed private key and create such a signature with cryptographic-id-rs (https://gitlab.com/cryptographic_id/cryptographic-id-rs). This is similar to tpm2-totp (https://github.com/tpm2-software/tpm2-totp) but uses asymmetric cryptography. This means you do not need to keep the verification code secure. You can share it safely with the world.

- Verify the identity of a phone

You can generate a private key when your phone is in a trustworthy state. If your phone can create a correct signature, you know it is the same phone. Since the operating system can access the private key, the security guarantees are much weaker than with a TPM2. So the verification is just as secure as your phone. If you use Graphene OS, also have a look at Auditor (https://attestation.app/tutorial).

- Verify that a person is in possession of a private key

This works as well as the section above but has the same shortcomings. It can be used to verify someone in person when he sends his public key to you in advance over a secure channel.

No need to navigate through complicated menus to find a particular tea, or fiddle with settings... unless you want to customize brew times or add your own favorite teas.

Once you tap, Cuppa will begin timing the brew and you'll see a teabag appear in the cup and gradually darken as the tea steeps. A countdown timer shows the steep time remaining. You can have up to two separate teas brewing at once, each with its own countdown timer. When the tea is done Cuppa will let you know with a notification -- depending on your device settings, this may be accompanied by a sound and/or vibration.

Without a background, each icon looks unique and breaks the constant pattern of the grid. All icons have a black border which allows them to fit on most backgrounds. The color palette is retained and integrated into the icon. This makes the icons easy to recognize. Cuscon also brings a natural consistency to the size of the icons. All icons have the same spacing, resulting in a standard size without the need to mask icons. Unlike many other icon packs, Cuscon's philosophy supports the creation of icons for games and other complex icons. Therefore, it is possible to have Cuscon fully applied without annoying unedited icons that don't fit the theme. Since Cuscon is open source, anyone can contribute icons and other changes on Github. Cuscon supports most launchers such as Apex, Nova, Smart, Kiss, Lawnchair and others. You can request icons that have not yet been added to the application. Most calendars can update based on the date if the correct launcher is used.

Ham radio ops who like QRP will sooner or later want to learn Morse code so they can communicate using CW. This app teaches amateur radio enthusiasts how Morse code works and helps them build their speed.

Custom-Tailored Lessons
You set your current level of proficiency and what you aim for (e.g. all letters with 20 words per minute). Dahdidahdit guides you from where you are to where you want to be — It teaches you new letters when you are ready and increases your speed when you seem bored. 

Requirements
The only things you need (other than a phone and the app) are a sheet of paper and a pen. 

Usage
When you start the session, Dahdidahdit plays Morse code letters so you can determine which speed you are comfortable with. You jot down the letters you recognized. When the session ends, Dahdidahdit shows you what it sent and you compare notes. Then you tap the button that shows the number of mistakes. 

Automated Curriculum
When you complete enough practice sessions with only a few mistakes, Dahdidahdit starts the next lesson, by introducing a new letter or by increasing the speed.

Additional Features
<ul>
<li>Learning Q-codes</li>
<li>Sending practice using either an on-screen or an actual paddle connected by USB</li>
<li>Morse QSOs via internet with Morserino or Dahdidahdit users</li>
<li>Game: Morse Tennis</li>

dailyLog works by accessing a single text file of your choosing: keeping your data on your device and accessible in any app you choose. But unlike a blank text file, dailyLog lets you define custom shortcut buttons. Imagine a workout log where tapping the ""chest"" button pastes ""chest press: reps, lbs"", allowing you to log your workouts with ease.

Course contents are queried from the server and stored for offline usage. Marked-up content and embedded images are usually displayed correctly. An in-app user help menu documents many of the application's features.

At this moment, only some of the basic modules are supported. However, opening an unsupported module will, through magic, automatically sign you in to your browser before opening there – providing a very convenient access to all types of content.

It easily remove system apps from ""/system"", ""/vendor"", and ""/product"" directories.

<i>De-Bloater</i> requires Root Access and a fully functional Magisk or Kernel SU environment, including modules, for proper working. As a result, De-Bloater won't work with other rooting solutions as well as in Magisk core-only mode.

<b>Features</b>

- Easily remove system applications from ""/system"", ""/vendor"", and ""/product"" directories (Reboot required).
- Restore de-bloated apps, either individually or as a whole (Reboot required).
- Includes pre-defined de-bloated scripts (Universal Android and Tomatot debloater).
- Elegantly designed user interface with an auto-dark/light theme.
- A lot more.

<b>How to Use</b>

Open the app, click the remove button on each app you want to remove. The selected apps will be removed systemless-ly after a reboot. To restore an app, either Reset Module (on the top menu) or selectively restore from the second page. Please note that a restart is necessary to get any of the changes in effect.

The app will systemless-ly replace the selected APKs by making a Magisk/Kernel SU module. As a result, you will see a new Module (name: De-bloater).

<b>Troubleshooting</b>

In case, if you accidentally remove some important apps and your phone bootloops, please delete ""/data/adb/modules/De-bloater"" via recovery.

encrypt all of the metadata that is possible to encrypt in the TLS

implementations, platforms, and networks.
 
The Encrypted ClientHello (ECH) mechanism (IETF draft spec) is a way to
plug a few privacy-holes that remain in the Transport Layer Security
(TLS) protocol that's used as the security layer for the web. OpenSSL
is a widely used library that provides an implementation of the TLS
protocol. The DEfO project is developing an implementation of ECH for
OpenSSL, and various clients and servers that use OpenSSL as a
demonstration and for interoperability testing.

This uses the mirror of f-droid.org that is on Cloudflare with ECH
enabled: https://cloudflare.f-droid.org

DEfO was initially funded by the Open Technology Fund, and
subsequently by the National Democratic Initiative. Tolerant Networks

This convenient feature ensures that you can access your messages even when you're away from your device, providing you with greater flexibility and convenience in managing your conversations.

Key Features:
- End-to-end encryption: Protect your SMS conversations with robust encryption, giving you peace of mind that your messages are secure.
- Image sharing: Easily send and receive images over SMS, making your conversations more engaging and expressive.
- Message forwarding: Configure the app to forward your SMS messages to your online servers, allowing you to access your messages from any device.

Deku SMS is an open-source project, and we believe in the power of community collaboration. We encourage developers and enthusiasts to explore our codebase on GitHub, where they can contribute to the app's development and customization.

Enter a sequence of numbers that you obtained from a pseudo random number generator like, for instance, the Java standard pseudo random number generator or the Mersenne Twister MT19937.  The app will then try to predict following numbers from the generator.

The app expects all numbers to be entered as integers or floating point numbers between zero and one.  Currently, floating point numbers are supported for the Mersenne Twister only.  Three input modes are supported:
1. <em>Text field</em> lets you enter the numbers directly on the device.
2. <em>File</em> lets you choose a file with newline separated number strings.
3. <em>Socket</em> opens a server socket on the device.  You can then connect with a custom client by means of a client socket and send newline separated number strings to the server.  After each number the server will send back the next newline separated predictions.  Each block of predictions is separated by an additional newline.

To test the app, enter the following numbers in the <em>Text field</em>:
<code>
1412437139
1552322984
168467398
1111755060
-928874005
</code>

These numbers were sampled from the Java linear congruential generator <em>Random.nextInt()</em>.  Thus, the app should detect <em>LCG: Java</em> after the third number input, and numbers in the prediction history should appear in green instead of red, indicating that those numbers were correctly predicted.

The source code of this app is published on GitLab.  There you can also find a Python program for testing socket input: https://gitlab.com/asnelt/derandom/blob/HEAD/README.md

No sign-up is needed.

The user selects a file on their device and shares the generated code with the intended recipient for safe delivery.

Destiny is based on the Magic Wormhole protocol.

Key security features:

- End-to-end encryption: Files are end-to-end encrypted and only the sender and recipient can read them.

- Identity-less: No need to disclose identity information (such as name, email address, or phone number) to be able to transfer files.

- Peer-to-peer file transfer: Destiny attempts to make a direct network connection to the other party. When this isn’t possible (for example, if neither party has a public IP address), then our relay server is used. However, that server sees only encrypted packets.

- Full-strength keys: Although our codes are short and human-memorable, they are part of an online “Password Authenticated Key Exchange” (PAKE) which only allows a single guess – and yields a 256-bit full-strength symmetric key.

Or that we will not use the app Y for more than Z minutes. These contracts are often reinforced with financial incentives, i.e. if we fail we will have to pay a fee of a few dollars to the developers.

This app follows a different approach by stripping away all the attention-grabbing and manipulative features of other apps. DetoxDroid does not require you to choose a time and place when you want to ""detox"", or punish you if you fail. Instead, it aims to enable you to use your phone rather than letting your phone use you.

FEATURES
* Grayscale: Going grayscale removes positive reinforcements and dampens compulsive smartphone use.
* Exceptions: Exclude apps like your camera or gallery from the grayscale feature.
* Automatic Do Not Disturb: Never forget to enter the ""Do Not Disturb"" mode.
* Opt-out > Opt-in: Deliberately pause DetoxDroid rather than deliberately switching it on.

INSTALLATION
Unfortunately, installing the app on your phone is not enough for the grayscale feature to work. If your phone is rooted, you can grant the necessary permissions from the app. Otherwise, you need to grant the WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS permission from your computer.
Don't worry though, this usually will not take you more than a few minutes. Find out how to do it on GitHub: https://github.com/flxapps/DetoxDroid#installation

Messenger for secured chats and groups (end-to-end encrypted).

Dib2Qm is a messenger that works via e-mail servers, end-to-end encrypted.

Currently only as experimental version! Some of the following features are
not supported yet.

Text messages are not only end-to-end encrypted, they also get stored on your
device in an encrypted way. Images, attachments etc. can be sent -- encrypted,
of course, but since they depend on third-party programs, they are stored
unencrypted. Dib2Qm makes use of your device's 'Download' folder (also for
backups and archives).

You need an e-mail account (on a server with standard IMAP and SMTP services),
for which a small app like this one is allowed to access the services.

Just try it out! -- on a non-critical device (And if your e-mail provider blocks
it, use a different provider. Dib2Qm does not depend on a centralized server.)

- You can only chat with people who also use Dib2Qm.
- After the setup, please first start the messaging service (via menu).
- If you get a connection, the status should turn green (... 'ON').
- Add a contact, via menu: you have to enter the other one's e-mail address.
- If you then touch the new contact, you will be asked to send the 'invitation'
(i.e. the key info for exchanging secured messages).
- Once the key exchange is completely done (black/red, orange, green), the chat
works similar to other apps.

If one of your chats gets 'stuck' (due to a key exchange problem), just send
another 'invitation' from within the chat.

It is possible to use the address of your device's 'Google account', but they
insist on you explicitly allowing messenger apps: you would log in with your
browser (!), go to 'Settings', 'Forwarding...IMAP', 'Enable IMAP', 'Save', then
to 'Accounts', 'Other ... settings', '...Security', '2-Step...', 'Off', and
'Connected apps', 'Allow less secure', 'On'.

Strange? It is easier to use an extra e-mail account for Dib2Qm, but depending
on your provider you might still have to allow IMAP services. Both, using the
device's account address or using a dedicated e-mail address for Dib2Qm, have
their advantages and disadvantages ...

If you want to do a complete re-start, go to the device's settings, clear the
app data, then open a file manager, clear the 'Download/dibdib' data, and then
you can start the app a-fresh.

1. Minimum amount of permissions:
The ""VIBRATE"" permission (category “Other”) is required to provide the vibration feedback.
Most of dicing apps in the Google Play Store require additional permissions, the top ten requires an average of 2,9 permissions (June 2016). Those are e.g. accessing the network or Internet which is mostly used to display advertisement. Some apps have access to GPS or telephony data.

2. No advertisement:
Many other apps in the Google Play Store display advertisement and therefore might violate the user’s privacy, shorten battery life or usage mobile data.

<b>What is the Common Voice project?</b>

Common Voice is Mozilla's initiative to help teach machines how real people speak.
Voice is natural, voice is human. That’s why we’re excited about creating usable voice technology for our machines. But to create voice systems, developers need an extremely large amount of voice data.
Most of the data used by large companies isn’t available to the majority of people. We think that stifles innovation. So we’ve launched Common Voice, a project to help make voice recognition open and accessible to everyone.
Now you can donate your voice to help us build an open-source voice database that anyone can use to make innovative apps for devices and the web. Read a sentence to help machines learn how real people speak. Check the work of other contributors to improve the quality. It’s that simple!
You can find more details on the official website <a href=""https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/"">https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/</a>
</p>
<p>
<b>Why should you use the app instead of the website on mobile?</b>

The app is developed specifically for smartphones so it's native. It has many features that website don't provide you, such as dark theme, offline mode, customisation, gestures, etc.
The app is lighter than website, without annoying animations (and animations in the app can also be stopped in Settings).
In addition, the website has many bugs, especially for mobile-version, so you cannot do everything correctly.

Helps you set up your phone background tasks so that your apps can finally work for YOU even when not looking at the screen right now.

See how is your phone doing and test different settings with DontKillMyApp benchmark.

Features:
• DKMA benchmark: Measure how aggressively is your phone killing background apps
• Guides: Get actionable steps to overcome most background process restrictions
• Make a change:️Help smartphones stay smart by sharing your benchmark report to dontkillmyapp.com

DontKillMyApp is a benchmark tool to see how well does your phone support background processing. You can measure before setting up your phone, then go through the setup guides and benchmark again to see how much has your phone been slacking in the background.

You can share your report through the app to the maintainers of the dontkillmyapp.com website who compile it and base the overall negative score on it.

How does the benchmark work? (Technical!)

The app starts a foreground service with a wake lock and schedules repetitive task on the main thread, a custom thread executor and schedules regular alarms (AlarmManager.setExactAndAllowWhileIdle). Then it calculates executed vs. expected. That's it!

For more details check the code. The app is open source available it https://github.com/urbandroid-team/dontkillmy-app

<b>Features</b>
Technical
    Jetpack Compose
    Material3 and Dynamic Color

<b>Game</b>
    Variable game board grid size from three-by-three to nine-by-nine (Larger than nine-by-nine is simply ridiculous and unplayable in mobile phones)
    Variable game ai difficulty (easy, medium, hard)

Variations
Simple Game

The Simple game is the most simple variation of Tic-tac-tao with a three-by-three grid with two players. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal is the winner.

Simple Game AI

Currently, in hard mode, AI uses a strategy rather than an AI search algorithm like MinMax. This strategy consists of these steps: Win, Block, Fork, Block Fork, Center Play, Corner Play, and Side Play.
In Easy difficulty, AI plays a random empty cell in the grid. In Medium difficulty, AI chooses between Easy difficulty and Hard difficulty for each move based on a 50/50 chance.

File and text encryption in Android offers crucial benefits in protecting sensitive data. By encrypting files and text, users can prevent unauthorized access, ensuring confidentiality and privacy. This is especially vital in a world where mobile devices often contain personal, financial, and business-related information. Encryption adds an additional layer of security, preventing malicious actors from intercepting or tampering with data, thus mitigating the risk of data breaches and identity theft.

Features:

  -  Uses AES-256-GCM for encryption

  -  Uses Scrypt for key derivation with CPU/Memory cost of 32768, block size of 16, and parallelization of 4

This allows you to store files in encrypted vaults that other apps can't decrypt.
Currently, DroidFS supports the following encrypted containers:
- gocryptfs (https://github.com/rfjakob/gocryptfs): encrypts file contents and file names but doesn't hide directory structure or file sizes.
- CryFS (https://github.com/cryfs/cryfs): slower, but encrypts everything and obfuscates file sizes.

<b>Features:</b>
- Compatible with original encrypted volume implementations
- Internal support for video, audio, images, text and PDF files
- Built-in camera to take on-the-fly encrypted photos and videos
- Ability to expose volumes to other applications
- Unlocking volumes using fingerprint authentication
- Volume auto-locking when the app goes in background

<b>Permissions:</b>
<b>Read & write access to shared storage:</b> required to access volumes located on shared storage.
<b>Biometric/Fingerprint hardware:</b> needed to encrypt/decrypt password hashes using a fingerprint protected key.
<b>Camera:</b> required to take encrypted photos or videos directly from the app.
<b>Record audio:</b> required if you want sound on videos recorded with DroidFS.
<b>Notifications:</b> used to report file operations progress and notify about volumes kept open

All of these permissions can be denied if you don't want to use the corresponding feature.

DroidFS is free, open-source, and you can find the project's repository:

  <li>Android 10 or higher</li>
  <li>Unlocked Bootloader</li>
  <li>Device with Dynamic Partitions</li>
  <li>GSI you want to use!</li>
</ul>

For those who don't know, explaining in a really quick and simplified way, DSU (Dynamic System Updates), is a feature introduced on Android 10, that let developers boot GSIs without touching current system partition, this is done by creating new partitions to hold a GSI and a separated userdata, to boot on them when desired.

You must unlock device bootloader before using DSU, locked bootloader will only allow booting images from trusted signatures (which in reality, for most devices, means that it will only boot images signed by device OEM), for this reason, unlocked bootloader is a requirement, also, installing images with locked bootloader in some devices may be dangerous.

Once installation finishes, Android creates a persistent notification allowing you to boot into ""Dynamic System"" (GSI installed via DSU), and you can boot into installed GSI, without touching your system partition, or breaking the ""real userdata"" partition.

After booting Dynamic System, you can try and test whatever you want, when you need to switch back to device's original system image, everything you need to do, is just, a simple reboot!

That is, of course, assuming you don't have access to root privileges. However, you might not desire to root your phone, either because it can turn out to be quite difficult to achieve, or because it has numerous disadvantages in itself, anyway.<br />

To prevent them from being leaked or exploited by the BAD GUY.

Of course, it is also suitable for making emojis.
After all, it supports image watermarking with very ghostly effects. 

## Characteristics
### Exciting 👓

Purely offline local applications , code to see on open source.
Vertical and horizontal spacing can be adjusted, the color of light and dark change at will.
Rotate freely in all sizes and angles, text and pictures can be printed.
The watermark repeats all over the picture, and it's a little hard for the bad guys to remove it.

### Seriously (pushes up glasses)

- Security:
The code is completely open source and uses a loose MIT protocol, you are free to Fork yourself to modify and remove code you think is problematic ;)
No network requests, no network request permissions, no fear of your photos being compromised. users with API >= 29 don't even need to request any permissions. (28 and below users need to apply for storage permissions to access and store photos)
And of course there are no stats, buried points or Device IDs, or even crash reporting (so if you get a crash, please share the crash info with us >_<).
We're forgoing the convenient third-party collection SDK and various stats just so you can use it with confidence. What's yours is yours.
- Layout: support for horizontal and vertical intervals between the watermark, automatically repeat the full picture.
- Style: font color, transparency, size and rotation angle can be adjusted.
- Content: Support text watermark and image watermark.

## Use
You can use it however you want. It is more suitable for situations where you need to submit a photo ID, a hand-held photo ID or a sensitive photo. Example.

Various real names in the country, uploading front and back photos of ID cards at every turn, even handheld ID photos.
Pre-project previews, samples, copyrighted or simply spoofed images
Reference text.

This photo is for xx for xxx purposes only, no other use.

You can turn down the transparency, just don't block the key information.

(For now) we can't (temporarily) prevent information from being uploaded, or even (temporarily) prevent information from being leaked, but we can reduce the value of the information being leaked.

Even if it's (probably) useless in the end, at least you can disgust the leaker a bit.

## UI
Designed by renowned UI guru @tovi (👏🤪)
Anything you think doesn't work well is my UI restore that doesn't work, and has nothing to do with the UI draft. xD

WARNING:
If you just want to have access to the files on your PC from your Android phone, then sshfs is a
VERY bad solution for that problem. You really need to know some internal details about Android
storage implementation to make something useful with sshfs. And EasySSHFS is not intended to hide
all these details from its users. Please try to use any implementation of Android document provider
for sftp protocol (or any other solution to work with sftp) before trying to use sshfs.

NOTE:
- If you are using SuperSu to manage root access and have no effect after mounting done, try to disable ""mount namespace separation"" option in SuperSU.
- It is highly recommended to create mount points in /data/media/0 on Android 4.2 and /mnt/runtime/default/emulated/0 on Android 6.0 and above.

    <b>Background</b><br/>
    The chimp test, also known as the Ayumu memory test, is a test designed to assess working memory.<br/>
    It was popularized by a study conducted at the Primate Research Institute of Kyoto University in Japan, where chimpanzees demonstrated remarkable short-term memory abilities.<br/>
    Chimps seem to, effectively, have a photographic memory (eidetic memory).
    <br/>
    Untrained humans generally perform significantly worse than chimpanzees on the chimp test. So, this app trains you. The hope is that we can eventually match or beat chimp records.

This chat app uses end-to-end encryption to provide powerful video conferencing, file sharing and voice calls.

<b>Element’s features include:</b>
- Advanced online communication tools
- Fully encrypted messages to allow safer corporate communication, even for remote workers
- Decentralized chat based on the Matrix open source framework
- File sharing securely with encrypted data while managing projects
- Video chats with Voice over IP and screen sharing
- Easy integration with your favourite online collaboration tools, project management tools, VoIP services and other team messaging apps

Element is completely different from other messaging and collaboration apps. It operates on Matrix, an open network for secure messaging and decentralized communication. It allows self-hosting to give users maximum ownership and control of their data and messages.

<b>Privacy and encrypted messaging</b>
Element protects you from unwanted ads, data mining and walled gardens. It also secures all your data, one-to-one video and voice communication through end-to-end encryption and cross-signed device verification.

Element gives you control over your privacy while allowing you to communicate securely with anyone on the Matrix network, or other business collaboration tools by integrating with apps such as Slack.

<b>Element can be self-hosted</b>
To allow more control of your sensitive data and conversations, Element can be self-hosted or you can choose any Matrix-based host - the standard for open source, decentralized communication. Element gives you privacy, security compliance and integration flexibility.

<b>Own your data</b>
You decide where to keep your data and messages. Without the risk of data mining or access from third parties.

Element puts you in control in different ways:
1. Get a free account on the matrix.org public server hosted by the Matrix developers, or choose from thousands of public servers hosted by volunteers
2. Self-host your account by running a server on your own IT infrastructure
3. Sign up for an account on a custom server by simply subscribing to the Element Matrix Services hosting platform

<b>Open messaging and collaboration</b>
You can chat with anyone on the Matrix network, whether they’re using Element, another Matrix app or even if they are using a different messaging app.

<b>Super secure</b>
Real end-to-end encryption (only those in the conversation can decrypt messages), and cross-signed device verification.

<b>Complete communication and integration</b>
Messaging, voice and video calls, file sharing, screen sharing and a whole bunch of integrations, bots and widgets. Build rooms, communities, stay in touch and get things done.

<b>Pick up where you left off</b>
Stay in touch wherever you are with fully synchronised message history across all your devices and on the web at https://app.element.io

<b>Open source</b>
Element Android is an open source project, hosted by GitHub. Please report bugs and/or contribute to its development at https://github.com/element-hq/element-android

Seamless. On Matrix,"Element X brings you both sovereign & seamless collaboration built on Matrix.

The collaboration capabilities include chat & video calls with the modern set of features such as:
 • public & private channels
 • room moderation & access control
 • replies, reactions, polls, read receipts, pinned messages, etc.
 • simultaneous chat & calls (picture in picture)
 • decentralized & federated communication across organizations

All this comes in a secure & sovereign fashion without compromising responsiveness or overall usability of the app:
 • enterprise-grade single sign-on
 • easy & secure login & device verification via QR-code
 • end to end encryption & zero trust
 • protection against MITM & other cyber attacks

If you’re a new user, use the new Element X app from the start. Compared to the current Element app you will get:
 • greatly enhanced performance, sleek user interface and overall better user experience
 • enterprise-grade support for single sign-on (OIDC)
 • QR-code based login & device verification
 • natively integrated Element Call for video calls
 • continuous improvements, bug fixes and new features

If you’re an existing user, using the current Element app - check out the new Element X and start planning your transition. The current Element app will be phased out and will only get critical security updates.

<b>Own your data</b>
Matrix-based, Element X lets you self-host your data or choose from any free public server (the default is matrix.org, but there are plenty of others to choose from). However you host, you have ownership; it’s your data. You’re not the product. You’re in control.

<b>Interoperate natively</b>
Enjoy the freedom of the Matrix open standard! You have native interoperability with any other Matrix-based app. So just like email, it doesn't matter if your friends, partners or customers are on a different Matrix-based app - you can still connect.

<b>Encrypt your data</b>
Enjoy your right to private conversations - free from data mining, ads and all the rest of it - and stay secure. Only the people in your conversation can read your messages.

<b>Chat across multiple devices</b>
Stay in touch wherever you are with fully synchronized message history across all your devices, even those running Element legacy app, and on the web at https://app.element.io

The application requires the android.permission.REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES permission to enable the installation of applications received as attachments, ensuring seamless and convenient access to new software within the app.

The application requires the USE_FULL_SCREEN_INTENT permission to ensure our users can effectively receive call notifications even when their devices are locked.

screen, and on top of that, it also disables motion sensors so Doze stays active

periodically to execute maintenance jobs (like getting notifications, etc),
otherwise it will remain active as long as your screen is off. This brings a lot
more battery savings than standard Doze functionality, because even with screen
off and Doze enabled, Doze is still periodically checking for movement, and
disabling motion sensing improves battery life further.

**Features**

FEATURES

- Secure Backups
Auth provides end-to-end encrypted cloud backups so that you don't have to worry about losing your tokens. We use the same protocols Ente Photos uses to encrypt and preserve your data.

- Multi Device Synchronization
Auth will automatically sync the 2FA tokens you add to your account, across all your devices. Every new device you sign into will have access to these tokens.

- Web access
You can access your 2FA code from any web browser by visiting https://auth.ente.io .

- Offline Mode
Auth generates 2FA tokens offline, so your network connectivity will not get in the way of your workflow.

- Import and Export Tokens
You can add tokens to Auth by one of the following methods: 
1. Scanning a QR code
2. Manually entering (copy-pasting) a 2FA secret
3. Bulk importing from a file that contains a list of codes in the following format:

otpauth://totp/provider.com:you@email.com?secret=YOUR_SECRET

The codes maybe separated by new lines or commas.

You can also export the codes you have added to Auth, to an **unencrypted** text file, that adheres to the above format.

Additionally, it opens RSS podcast links when tapped in a web browser.


FREQUENT QUESTIONS

DOES ESCAPEPOD HAVE PLAYBACK QUEUE?
Escapepod has a simple up-next feature. Tap play on an episode while listening to another one. You will be be given the opportunity add it to the up-next slot.

WHAT ARE THE DEFAULT SETTINGS?
- Auto-update does not download files over cellular network
- Escapepod by default only keeps two episodes

CAN ESCAPEPOD KEEPS MORE THAN TWO EPISODES?
Escapepod tries to reduce the number of episodes it keeps. Here are the rules for that:
- Escapepod keeps the latest two episodes
- Episodes, that have been started, or that have been downloaded manually, are kept, too
- Episodes that have not been listened to in more than two weeks are removed.

DOES ESCAPEPOD SUPPORT OPML?
You can import a podcast list using the OPML exchange format using the respective option in the app's Settings. The current podcast collection can be exported via Settings, too. Additionally Escapepod keeps an up-to-date OPML file in the folder /Android/data/org.y20k.escapepod/files/collection/.

WHERE DO THE PODCAST SEARCH RESULTS COME FROM?
Escapepod searches by default the Podcastindex.org (https://podcastindex.org/) online database - or if you toggle the respective setting the gpodder.net (https://gpodder.net/directory/) online database.

Get data out of Android devices and into S3 buckets.

Features:

- The application can work with any S3-compatible storage provider. This
  includes Amazon AWS, Vultr Object Storage, IDrive®, and many other commercial
  offerings. Additionally, the application can work with self-hosted S3 storage
  solutions such as MinIO.
- The application can (recursively) upload the contents of any directory on an
  Android device to which it has been granted access. The set of directories
  is configurable.
- The application conserves precious bandwidth by avoiding uploading files that
  already exist on the remote storage. The cryptographic hashes of files are
  computed locally and files are only uploaded if the hashes of
  the files on the remote server do not match.
- The application can be configured to upload files on a timed schedule,
  and/or in response to various events occurring on the device such as a photo
  being taken, or the network becoming available.
- The application vigorously respects the privacy of users: The application
  contains no telemetry or analytics of any kind, and never collects any user data.
- Development of the application is performed in the open. The complete source code is made available under
  an extremely liberal ISC license, and development and bug tracking is handled
  in a public GitHub repository.
- The application rejects bug-prone Android programming practices and libraries
  and instead strives for correctness and stability using battle-hardened,
  well-tested components designed outside the traditional Android ecosystem.
- The application adopts a cautious development approach and does not pursue
  huge sets of complex features. The application attempts to adhere to the Unix
  philosophy and provide a simple, sharp tool that does one thing well.
- The application attempts to respect the intelligence of users. Technical
  details of many aspects of the system are clearly displayed onscreen, and
  important information is not hidden in the misguided pursuit of
  ""user-friendliness"".

Thumbnails are added to the EXIF metadata structure.

It is designed to work from android Oreo (android 8, SDK 26).

Please report issues here: <a href=""https://github.com/tenzap/exif-thumbnail-adder/issues"">https://github.com/tenzap/exif-thumbnail-adder/issues</a>

For more information, some known facts and how you may contribute, refer to the [project homepage][1].

<b>Rationale</b>

On some smartphones, when wanting to import pictures to Windows (or any device/operating system supporting MTP or PTP protocols), I noticed the pictures may not display a thumbnail in the import wizard (whether through the Photos app, or through the Windows Explorer import feature).

There are two possible reasons for that behaviour. First, the thumbnail is not present in the picture, usually because the app that created the picture didn't add a thumbnail. Second, there is a thumbnail but it is ignored because some EXIF tags are missing.


<b>Features</b>

- Add thumbnail to pictures (JPEG) that don't yet have one
- Lanczos algorithm to downsample picture thanks to [FFmpeg's swscale library][2] for best results.
- Select one or more folders to scan from any storage (internal, SDCard...). For example DCIM, Pictures...
- Exclude one subdirectory from selected directories
- Preserve timestamps of the pictures
- Processing log
- Synchronize deleted files in the source directory to the backup and working directory (so that you don't keep in the backup folder pictures you don't have anymore in the source folder)
- Conservative default options (backup pictures, skip corrupt files)
- Install app on internal storage or external storage
- Default EXIF library: [Exiv2][3].
- Alternative libraries: Android-Exif-Extended, libexif, pixymeta-android. See known facts on project page to learn more on benefits and drawbacks of each library.
- Settings: 
&emsp;- Rotate the thumbnail
&emsp;- Replace existing thumbnail
&emsp;- Backup of original pictures (backup is never overwritten by the app once created if you choose to add the thumbnail to the input file in its initial location)
&emsp;- Skip pictures having malformed metadata (this can be disabled to process also files having corrupt tags)
&emsp;- Replace picture in place or write new picture to another directory

Also known as text adventures, interactive books, playable novels, z-machine, glulx, tads, terps. Fun for adults and also a great way to encourage children to read and develop their imaginations.

Fabularium can play all of the major formats: Adrift (including version 5), AdvSys, the Adventure Game Toolkit (AGT), Alan (2 and 3), Glulx, Hugo, Level 9, Magnetic Scrolls, Scott Adams Adventures (Scottfree), Tads (2 and 3) and Zcode (Infocom). It also includes a simple integrated development environment (IDE) for creating your own Glulx, Tads 3 and Zcode games.

Fabularium supports Unicode games, so if you would prefer to play in a language other than English, no problems! Either define your own keyboard via the keyboards.ini file (see examples in that file) or disable the built-in keyboard via the settings, to use your system keyboard. Keyboards defined via keyboards.ini can have multiple layouts and each key can be programmed to generate one Unicode character, a complete command, or even multiple commands, that are fed to the interpreter one by one. As with anything else in fab.ini, you can set the different keyboards you've defined in keyboards.ini to automatically load with different game and terp combinations.

Fabularium takes accessibility seriously. Much of the app is now TalkBack enabled and the built-in keyboard supports ""explore by touch"" and ""lift to type"" technology. Accessibility features will continue to improve over the coming releases. If you are blind or vision-impaired and would like to help me with this (e.g. testing and feature suggestions), let me know.

We care about typography! While the default settings should work for most games, Fabularium is also highly customisable. Make the margins as narrow or as wide as you want. Don't like the default fonts and colours? Change them. Adjust line spacing. Fiddle with other typographical features. Optimise that game for your device's screen. For maximum screen space, try using a hardware keyboard.

Fabularium is and always will be completely free, with no ads, and open source. It does not come bundled with any games; you will need to obtain these separately. There are many games freely available at www.ifdb.tads.org and www.ifarchive.org. You can download these games anywhere to your internal storage/SD card and then add them to your library from within the app. The app is also able to extract files from ZIP archives.

Inspired by the great Gargoyle interpreter by Tor Andersson, Fabularium implements Andrew Plotkin's Glk 0.7.5 spec in Android and can therefore support any glk-enabled interpreter. More interpreters may be added in the future.

For further information see the in-app help.

It provides you with fertility charts based on your hormone levels so you can pinpoint your fertile window and track your early pregnancy days. Fertility Test Analyzer helps you get pregnant, especially if you have PCOS or irregular periods when ordinary ovulation calendars and trackers are not so helpful. It also makes you save money! Now you can buy cheap test strips in bulk knowing that you will be confident about the results once and for all!

Fertility Test Analyzer reads pregnancy and ovulation test strips, interprets their results and shows them in an easy and understandable way. Be reassured when reading the pigmentation level of an ovulation test or seeing a very faint line on a pregnancy test. Find out that you are pregnant before a missed period using the most sensitive tests in combination with our app. Join other pregnancy success stories! Using our  unique computer vision algorithm, Fertility Test Analyzer recognizes the pigmentation trace present in the test pad and gives you your long awaited answer.

KEY HIGHLIGHTS
✔ Read pregnancy and ovulation test strips without any doubts.
✔ Detect ovulation based on your hormone levels.
✔ Predict your fertile window.
✔ Improve your chances of pregnancy by better timing intercourse.
✔ Check on your pregnancy initial days following your hCG evolution with its fertility charts. 
✔ Access your data offline and review it when Internet access is not available.
✔ Keep pictures of your tests safely saved in your mobile phone.

IMPORTANT LIMITATIONS
Fertility Test Analyzer transforms qualitative data,given by the pregnancy and ovulation test strips, into quantitative data (% pigmentation). The accuracy of the numeric value is affected by a number of factors, such as: test quality, how diluted the urine is, the quality of the camera used, your skills in taking a good picture and a correct lighting. Hence, numeric results obtained cannot be taken as exact values, only a laboratory can give those.
Use at your own risk. Do not use to avoid pregnancy or anything where more accuracy would be required. Please consult your healthcare provider for any health concern.

AUTHORS' NOTE
The time has come to say goodbye.

Over the last years we created and give support to Fertility Test Analyzer in our spare time as part of a non-profit project. Our intention was to help women to reach their dream of become mothers, and we are happy to see that it has over 70k installations at the time.
Sadly we have to admit that we don't have the resources to keep up on new devices and therefore we have taken the decision of release the app to the public domain under a commercial free license. We expect other fertility apps to use this technology in the near future and we think that this is the best way we have to contribute to the well being of women with fertility difficulties.

Unfortunately we won't be giving support or maintenance to the app anymore. If you are an Android developer with some free time and want to contribute (there are a couple of things with priority if you have a modern device), the source code is on https://gitlab.com/colnix/fta. Please make a pull request or create a brand new app of your own! The only legal requirement is that you have to use it for good, not for evil :)

Thank you for join us throughout this project and we hope to see you soon in another adventure.

And because I don't use Google Services I couldn't locate it and my phone was gone for good.
In the hope that this doesn't happen again, I developed this application, so that I can locate the phone via SMS.

Features:

- Locate the device (using GPS or cellular location)
- Lock the device
- Let the device ring
- Take pictures with the device's camera to see its surroundings
- Factory-reset the device

Usage:

You can control FMD (and thus your phone) either via SMS or via FMD Server.
You send a command to the phone (e.g. ""fmd ring"") and the phone executes it.

For SMS you can either define a list of trusted contacts (phone numbers) that are allowed to send commands.
Or you can set a PIN to allow anonymous usage.
Then non-trusted phone numbers can also send commands by including the PIN in the message.
This is useful because now if you loose your phone, you can ask a random person for help to wipe your phone remotely.
If you simply text ""fmd"" to your phone FMD will reply with a text listing the available commands.

With FMD Server you get a web interface to send commands, to view the location of your device on a map,
and to view pictures taken by the device.
You can self-host FMD Server.
See here for more details: https://gitlab.com/nulide/findmydeviceserver

Disclaimer:

This app is provided on a best effort basis.
We hope it is useful, we use it ourselves, but this is a hobby project
and we can't guarantee that it will work when you need it the most.

It also has a ""tracker"" feature (it can’t be activated remotely, only manually). The application is designed to search for missing people or stolen phones. SMS is used for communication because Internet connectivity may be not available. The app has two ways of determining the coordinates: using GPS (gps must be enabled in system settings, or special permission granted via ADB for auto-enabling), and using mobile and WiFi network info.

<b>Important!</b> On Android 6.0 and newer for the Wifi networks searching feature, GPS must be enabled beforehand! (or enable GPS auto activating). GPS will not be used during network scanning, but nevertheless, newer versions of Android require it to be turned on (otherwise the system returns an empty list of networks). The app has a detailed help section, read it before use (but it is best to check whether the app works on a real device before use).

When location is retrieved using WiFi and mobile networks, the response SMS will have the MAC addresses of surrounding WiFi networks, and to determine the location it is necessary to have this application and a connection the Internet on the requesting phone (not needed on the remote [responding] side). This method can help in the case of trying to find a phone in a building / dense arrangement of buildings in the city.

Time in the ""history"" section - the local time of the requesting phone at the moment the coordinates were determined by the responding phone (included in sms).

An important feature is the fact that the application only responds to numbers from the ""trusted list"" and only when the ""respond to requests"" option is enabled! It is necessary to add the telephone numbers from which the requests will be sent in advance. The commands on the requesting and responding phones must be the same. It is possible to enable remote adding of phone nimbers to the ""trusted list"". If this mode is enabled (and the command is right) it allows you to remotely register a previously unknown number in the ""trusted list"". Finder displays notifications for any requests/responses.

It is also possible to send your coordinates manually to any number from ""trusted list"".

App can ring by request from trusted numbers. It disable ""don't disturb mode"", set 90% volume and play ringtone. To stop ringtone click on the notification, or it stops automatically after time from settings. Volume remain on original value.

MIUI users (and possibly some other OSes) need to apply additional system settings to make the application operate reliably. This is described in detail in the built-in help.

If the tracker function is  enabled, the device sends its coordinates to one of the trusted numbers with a set period. On the other device incoming SMS are parsed and a track is displayed on the map. Tracks can be exported in GPX format to be used in other navigation applications (the only difference from standard is local time instead UTC).

Permissions are requested immediately at the start, because they will be needed later for determining the coordinates in the background. Description of required permissions:

<i>Access to location</i> - obvious, for retrieving location.
<i>Access to SMS</i> - ""receive"" - for detecting commands, ""read"" - needed in the case of the app not detecting having receivied SMS with network data, ""send"" - to send location and commands.
<i>Write to external storage</i> - for cache of map and export track in gpx.
*<i>Read phone state</i> - requested only for android 8.0 due to a bug in this version of the OS (only in 8.0).
<i>WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS</i>, <i>WRITE_SETTINGS</i> - needed for automatically activating GPS on device (app can work without this permission, but GPS should be enabled manually beforehand). Can be granted using an ADB command: ""adb shell pm grant ru.seva.finder android.permission.WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS"", for more info see https://githu",1

<p>Initially, we had an idea to take the Gloomy Dungeons 2 engine, use cool cartoon graphics (instead of 8-bit), change levels a little, and go on. But in the middle of the process it became clear that it would take much more time :)</p>
<ul>
<li>We completely redesigned the tutorial. We hope that it will be not too complicated for beginners, and, on the other hand, it will not be too dull for experienced players in 3d–action games.</li>
<li>The minimap has completely changed. Instead of turning it on and off (as in the original Gloomy), it is now always visible. In addition, it always shows where to go (instead of arrows on the floor, as it was before), so you won’t get lost in endless labyrinths.</li>
<li>The game was carefully rebalanced (it is a shame, but earlier we did it almost randomly). It’s up to you to decide whether we’ve done it well or not, but to our taste it became much more fun to play.</li>
<li>We’ve added the ability to quickly change weapons (instead of constantly entering the menu). It seems to us that this is a handy feature, especially at the final levels, in order to quickly switch between grenades and winchester.</li>
<li>And finally, the main feature that distinguishes this game from our previous ones is the use of procedural generation as a base for creating levels. Of course, we did not put the generated levels as is - each of them was corrected by hands with love. Nevertheless, it was procedural generation that set the basic structure and ""rhythm"" of the level. Perhaps, because of it, on some levels you will have to run back and forth, but, in our opinion, this adds something special to the game.</li>
</ul>
<p>Compared to Gloomy, this game is much more dynamic. No more boring monsters - only hardcore! If you loved 3D first person shooters (FPS), give this game a chance :)</p>
<p>And briefly for the rest of the features:</p>
<ul>
<li>35 levels.</li>
<li>7 different weapons.</li>
<li>More than 5000 enemies.</li>
<li>About 5 hours of gameplay.</li>
<li>24 achievements.</li>
<li>Each level have one or more secrets.</li>
</ul>
<p>Have fun!</p>

To do this, you can enter all your consumed food and drink as well as its weight.
The app will then calculate the total daily calorie consumption. The app also allows
an analysis of calorie consumption over a larger timeframe such as weeks
or months.

What functionality does this app include?
- Personalization through the creation of your own products
- Calculation of the total calorie count for the day
- Creation of statistics and graphs that show total and average calorie intake over a week or a month
- Calendar overview to quickly show daily overviews
- Encryption of data on the device
- Online search to find products quickly and easily

This app belongs to the group of Privacy Friendly Apps developed
by the research group SECUSO at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. You can find more information at https://secuso.org/pfa.

This food tracker does not collect any information about its users. The database
is encrypted to guarantee absolute privacy. Also this app does not require any dangerous permissions from the user. Only internet access is needed for
the search function. Additionally, this food tracker does not include any
tracking or any advertisements at all. This increases battery lifetime and reduces or eliminates data usage by this app.

Please note that the online search requests information from the OpenFoodFacts
database. This would theoretically allow the database to track a users nutritional
habits. For absolute privacy it is therefore recommended to not use the online
search feature (The request is not triggered until the 'search' button is pressed).
The app also works without an internet connection.

simple and unintrusive, Foreground helps you know what needs done without
getting in your way. Foreground also supports syncing with <a
href=""https://taskwarrior.org/"">Taskwarrior</a> servers.</p>

<h2 id=""syncing"">Syncing</h2>

<p>To set up sync, add your taskwarrior server credentials (provided by your
taskd server or a service like inthe.am or FreeCinc) to the settings menu, and
enable sync using the toggle. A test will be run to check if the settings are
valid, and the enable will stick if the config works. You can also configure
automatic syncing in this menu, or click the sync button on the main page to
start a sync.</p>

<h2 id=""implementation-details"">Implementation Details</h2>

<p>Unlike existing Taskwarrior apps for Android, Foreground does not run the
taskwarrior binary inside, but rather implements a taskwarrior sync client.
This allows for greater device compatibility and simplifies UI development but
it can cause issues when syncing if not done correctly.</p>

<h2 id=""current-limitations"">Current Limitations</h2>

<p>Foreground currently supports most features of Taskwarrior. Notable
exceptions involve handling of recurring events and display/editing of User
Defined Attributes. Recurring event instances created by other clients will be
shown by Foreground, but Foreground does not create recurring event instances
of its own at this time.  User Defined attributes are preserved internally but
are not yet exposed for viewing or editing.  These limitations will be resolved
in future releases.</p>

Simplicity, usability, speed were taken into account in the process of developing this educational program. This app provides excellent conditions for achieving high efficiency of memorization.


The features that are supported are:

    • Import/export of files.
    • Support CSV, Tab text or any other kind of Delimiter-Separated Values.
    • Intervals (Spaced repetition). You can specify your own interval scheme for each deck. Also it is possible to indicate one's own algorithm of how the answers affects the choice of the next interval.
    • Several test methods. There are 'Self testing', 'Testing with variants', 'Spell check'.
    • Pronunciation of the text via TTS. You can choose languages for questions and answers, enable autospeaking of them.
    • Hiding the text of a question to stimulate improvement of listening skills that is very useful in foreign language learning.
    • Card inversion.
    • Hints in the form of masking letters.
    • 'Motivational timer' that will make you concentrate on your studies (optionally).
    • Saving settings of deck as presets and reusing them in order to avoid routine work on settings.
    • Editing and searching cards right in the exercise.
    • 'Walking mode' that enables you do the exercise without looking at the screen.
    • 'Autoplaying mode'. In this mode questions and answers are pronounced sequentially. You can combine your own activities and repetition of teaching material.
    • Catalog of pre-made decks. The catalog contains many decks for language learning, which includes basic sets of words, thematic words and phrases, whole sentences.
    • Grouping decks into separate lists.
    • Customizing the card appearance.
    • Dark theme.
    • Backup.


What makes ForgetMeNot so efficient for memorizing:

    - No amount of advertising. You can handle a lot of cards in a short time due to the simplicity and convenience of the user interface. Nothing prevents you from studying.
    - The exercise is designed so that you must eventually grasp the answer. If your answer is wrong, the card is postponed to the end of the list until you answer correct.
    - Intervals (Spaced repetition). Spaced repetition reduces the forgetting that occurs when material is not encountered for a significant time period. It also involves actively recalling learned material, which supports learning.
    - Possibility to edit a card just in the exercise. This allows you not only to correct mistakes, but also to rebuild cards if they are difficult to remember. For example, you can add an additional association in parentheses.
    - Voice accompaniment. This is especially helpful when learning languages because it improves listening skills, helps to focus on studying and favors memorization. You can even set up a deck to perceive a question exceptionally by ear.
    - Modes that allow you to practice not only in your free time. 'Walking mode' enables you do the exercise during walking. 'Autoplaying mode' lets you listen to questions and answers when your hands and eyes are busy, but your ears are free : )
    - Focusing aids. 'Motivational timer' reminds you when you've lost your attention. Full screen mode hides the status bar, which might be an additional source of distraction.


ForgetMeNot is free and open-source software.

-------------------------------------------------
<b>UI/Handling</b>
-------------------------------------------------

FOSS Browser uses the latest Material You design libraries. Following system day/night mode and a wallpaper based theme are just two features of this new library. The UI is optimized for one-hand-use. All UI-elements are at the bottom of the screen.

More features:

• Play audio on background.
• Keep screen on.
• Open links in background.
• Restore tabs on restart.


-------------------------------------------------
<b>Privacy</b>
-------------------------------------------------

FOSS Browser uses profiles to protect your privacy. For each profile you can enable or disable: AdBlock, JavaScript, cookies, fingerprint protection and much more. Profiles can also be saved for domains (""github.com"" ⇒ Trusted website). This saved domains always overwrite the current profile. So, for example, ""github.com"" will always open with the trusted profile, even if you are browsing in the protected mode.

More privacy features:

• Build in AdBlock, which updates automatically. You can decide which content to block. AdBlock hosts are taken from Steven Black - AbBlock hosts: https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts.
• Third-part-cookies can not be enabled.
• Enable or disable Android-autofill.
• Delete browser data (on app exit).
• Choose between different search engines (or set a custom one).
• FOSS Browser itself doesn't collect any data

-------------------------------------------------
<b>Gestures</b>
-------------------------------------------------

You can assign nearly twenty different gestures to the toolbar and the toolbar buttons. Each in four directions. You can also trigger events by long pressing the toolbar buttons. So you have up to ten different gestures to control FOSS Browser. Supported is for example: load last website, switch tab, reload, open bookmarks, ... and many more.


-------------------------------------------------
<b>Backups</b>
-------------------------------------------------

Backup all your important data (bookmarks, history, trusted websites and so on) on your SD-card. You can also back up FOSS Browser settings. Backups can even be restored on a fresh install or an other device (if you copy the backup files to the new device).",1

Players take turns in placing one tile onto the 20x20 board. The first tile for each player has to be placed in their corner of the board. Each following tile has to touch a corner of one of your previous tiles, but it must never share an edge. It may share edges with the opponents' tiles though. 
If a player has no more possible move, they have to pass. The game is over when no player can place a tile. 
For each player, the squares of all their tiles on the board are added up. The player with the most points  wins. 

HOW TO PLAY
- Swipe the list of available tiles with your finger. 
- Select and drag a tile onto the board. 
- Rotate or flip the tile using the 4 handles. 
- Place the tile in the desired position. The tile will appear green if the position is valid, and red otherwise. Possible corners are highlighted on the board for convenience. 
- Tap the tile in a valid position to place it. 
- You can rotate the board at any time to see the opponents' tiles. 

Quit the app at any time, your current game will be saved and restored on next start. 

FEATURES
- Supports 2-player modes, with 2 colors (Original, Blokus Duo and Blokus Junior), 4 colors (2 each),
- Customizable board sizes other than 20x20,
- Play against the computer or humans on the same device,
- Play online against your friends,
- Play with friends via Bluetooth,
- Hint and undo options,
- Looks great on tablets, too!

* Export settings to Google Drive or other document providers
* Import settings from Google Drive or other document providers

* Support Android 6.0 permissions.
* Enhanced UI with material design with dark theme support
* Search bar to search token
* Provide more token details for better interoperatibility with other apps
* Utilize modern camera hardware to scan QR code faster
* Option to require Biometric / PIN authentication to launch the app
* Heuristic based offline icon for tokens of 250+ websites.
* More settings to customize the app functionality

FreeOTP is a two-factor authentication (2FA) application for systems utilizing one-time password protocols (OTP).
Tokens can be added easily by scanning a QR-code or by manually entering in the token configuration.

FreeOTP implements open standards. This means that no proprietary server-side component is necessary:
use any server-side component that implements these standards — for example FreeIPA, which uses TOTP.
Any standards-compliant implementation will work.
Currently, FreeOTP provides implementations of HOTP (RFC 4226) and TOTP (RFC 6238).

- Eraser tool erases shapes from closed paths, or points from open paths
- Saving/loading SVG files

# Using FreePaint

## Paint tool
Using this tool, you can either draw open or closed paths. Simply go to the overflow menu > Settings to access this and more options.

## Eraser tool
When you select this tool, you can draw a shape to define the area you wish to erase. One of two things can happen depending on which path you want to erase from:
For closed paths, the entire path will become green, and you can draw a shape to erase from the path.
For open paths, individual points will become highlighted, and if those points are included in your eraser path, they will be deleted. Erasing a point inside a path will create 2 new paths.

## Pan/zoom tool
With one finger, you can pan across the document. If you pinch the screen with two, it'll zoom in and out from the center.

## Selection tool
You can draw a rectangle for an area you wish to select (marquee select). If any paths overlap that area, they will become ""selected"" and the rectangle will resize to include the selected paths.
You can drag on that rectangle to move those paths, or draw on an empty space to create a new selection.

<p>Life&#39;s adventures lead us to friendships that cross cities, countries, and even continents. While
these connections add immeasurable value to our lives, keeping them vibrant across distances can be
a challenge. Born from this universal struggle, FriendAlert is your go-to solution for keeping those
important friendships alive and well.</p>
<h1>Functions</h1>
<p>The application offers a simple reminder to remember to contact your friends: you can set how often you
want to keep in touch and every time you call a friend you can record that inside the app. If you
do not call one of your friends for a time longer than the limit you set, you'll be sent a notification.</p>
<p>🌍 <strong>Your Central Hub for Global Friendships</strong>
Whether your friendships were formed on the playground or during an international journey,
FriendAlert functions as your unified platform for sustaining these invaluable bonds. With
FriendAlert, neither miles nor time zones can weaken your connections.</p>
<p>🗣️ <strong>Foster Authentic Connections: More than Just Check-ins</strong>
Social media may offer cursory updates about people&#39;s lives, but it&#39;s no substitute for genuine
conversation. FriendAlert encourages you to engage in meaningful dialogues that go beyond the
superficial.</p>
<h1 id=""a-personal-perspective"">A Personal Perspective</h1>
<p>I created FriendAlert with the aim of maintaining contact with the people who matter most to me.
While the app&#39;s utility can vary, here are some personal guidelines I follow:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use FriendAlert to track those you find you&#39;re losing touch with, not the friends you see
regularly.</li>
<li>Although in-person meetings are irreplaceable, phone or video calls serve as excellent
alternatives when that&#39;s not feasible.</li>
<li>Texting, though convenient, falls short in conveying emotional nuance and should not be your
primary mode of communication.</li>
<li>Engaging via social media—such as liking photos or commenting—simply doesn’t cut it when it comes
to nurturing real friendships.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id=""elevate-your-social-ecosystem"">Elevate Your Social Ecosystem</h1>
<p>FriendAlert emerged from a personal need for an accessible, budget-friendly way to sustain my social
circle. While platforms like nouri.ai have their merits, FriendAlert offers a free and user-friendly
alternative.</p>
<p>Sharing good moments is nice. Let&#39;s enrich not just our conversations, but our lives and communities
through stronger, more meaningful connections.</p>",1

G-Droid kann das freie F-Droid-App-Repository durchsuchen. Es ist eine Alternative zum offiziellen Client.

# Zusätzliche Funktionen verglichen mit F-Droid

* Anzeige von Besprechungen und Kommentaren zu Apps
* App-Bewertungen mit Sternen (bis zu 5 Sterne) – maschinenerzeugte Kennzahlen
* Anzeige von Sterne-Bewertungen aus dem Upstream (GitHub, GitLab, SourceForge)
* Weitere Kennzahlen, die auf frei erhältlichen Daten (wie den durchschnittlichen Update-Intervallen) beruhen, um Sterne-Bewertungen zu erzeugen
* Anwender wählen die für sie wichtigen Kennzahlen aus, somit gibt es keine „beste App“ im Repo – es gibt nur eine „beste App“ aus Sicht des aktuellen Anwenders
* Anzeige „ähnlicher Apps“ und von „Apps aus derselben Kategorie“ beim Betrachten einer App
* Anzeige von „Apps desselben Autors“ beim Betrachten einer App
* Anzeige einer Liste aller Autoren, deren Apps und durchschnittlicher Bewertung
* Anzeige der App-Webseite – selbst wenn es „nur eine README-Datei auf GitHub“ ist
* Getrennte Anzeige der neusten Apps und der kürzlich aktualisierten Apps
* Anzeige von Karten in einheitlicher Größe zur besseren Übersicht
* Bietet eine Listenansicht als Alternative zu den Karten (wie in älteren F-Droid-Versionen) für Leute, die Karten nicht mögen
* Weitere Möglichkeiten, Apps zu ordnen und zu sortieren
* Möglichkeit, Apps als „Favorit“ zu markieren
* Möglichkeit, Apps auszublenden, um sie aus allen Ansichten zu entfernen
* Anzeige der Kategorien in korrekter Übersetzung (falls verfügbar) nach Änderung der Sprache auf dem Gerät
* Anzeige von Screenshots in korrekter Übersetzung
* Nutzt größere Bildschirme aus: Anzeige von mehr Apps auf Tablets
* Tags, um leicht Apps für Standardaufgaben (E-Mail-Clients, Dateibrowser, Texteditoren) zu finden, nachdem die F-Droid-Kategorien zu weit gefasst sind
* Ansicht für „zufällige Apps“, um Apps zu entdecken, die man normalerweise nicht finden würde
* Anzeige von Apps, die dem Anwender gefallen könnten (ohne dabei Nutzerdaten zur Analyse zu stehlen)
* Zielt darauf ab, dem Anwender viele verschiedene Sichten des App-Repositorys anzubieten, um ihn beim Finden geeigneter Apps zu unterstützen und ihn zu ermutigen, weitere Apps aus dem Repository zu verwenden
* Apps „teilen“, damit sie noch in anderen Stores (F-Droid, Yalp, Aurora, …) geöffnet werden können, um mehr Infos zur App zu erhalten
* Verschiedene Suchalgorithmen, kann „intensiver suchen“, um eine Suche, deren Ergebnis unbefriedigend war, fortzusetzen
* Ständige Anzeige der App-Logos (bei funktionierendem Netzwerk)
* Anzeige von mehr Screenshots
* Anzeige von Screenshots, vollständig, aktuell und in der richtigen Sprache
* Screenshot-Anzeige, auch wenn sie nicht in der Fastlane-Struktur sind
* Neuer, moderner, einfach zu pflegender Code
* Aktiv gewartet
* Weiteres in Planung

# Dinge, die G-Droid verglichen mit F-Droid (noch) NICHT kann

* Ältere Versionen einer App anzeigen oder installieren
* Ein lokales Repo erstellen, Apps mit Leuten „direkt“ oder über Bluetooth teilen
* Andere Repos als das F-Droid-Repo hinzufügen
* Die Rechteerweiterung nutzen (erledigt, aber die Erweiterung ist noch nicht eingestellt), G-Droid kann jedoch Root-Rechte für unbeaufsichtigte Installationen nutzen
* Automatische Updates
* HTTP-Proxy-Einstellungen
* G-Droid hilft auf verschiedene Art, bessere Apps zu finden, in bestimmten Fällen ist aber noch der „Teilen“-Button nötig, um die App in F-Droid zu öffnen und zu installieren. G-Droid ist momentan noch kein kompletter Ersatz für die F-Droid-App.

# Gemeinsamkeiten von G-Droid und F-Droid

* Anzeige derselben Apps – G-Droid ergänzt keine Apps, verändert keine Builds, Signaturen oder Download-URLs
* F-Droid liefert genauso alle zusätzlichen Metadaten (z. B. der Link zu GitHub)
* GPLv3+-Lizenz 

# Erklärung der Berechtigungen

* INTERNET: Zum Download von App-Metadaten und Apps
* WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE: Zum temporären Speichern heruntergeladener Apps (nur in älteren Android-Versionen gefordert)",1

You can use it to relax or to solve difficult grids to your opinion.

In classic mode, you solve a 9x9 grid by typing a value from 1 to 9 in each cell such as
- Each row and column contains each digit exactly once.
- Each cage meets its given mathematical problem. E.g. a group of cells labeled with '5+' must be filled such that the sum of all digits is 5.

Via game options, you may alter the game to solve other digits, smaller or greater grids, hiding the operators.


<b>Slick and modern UI</b>

- No switching of 'pencil mode' or such thing is  needed: To set a value of a cell, just use short-tap to alter a possible value and long-tap for a known value.
- 'Fast Finishing Mode' enables to fill cell with exactly one pencil mark rapidly. To be activated in the preferences.
- Uses colors from the painting 'The Siesta' from Paul Gauguin (guess where the app's name comes from…)


<b>Game options</b>

- grid sizes: 3x3 to 11x11 with classic 9x9
- includes rectangular grids, e.g. 7x9
- operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
- digits (1 to n, prime numbers, Fibonacci sequence etc.)
- difficulty (covering a increasing number of game variants)
- usage of single cells
- show or hide operators


<b>Things still to be done</b>

- not all grid variants get calculated in a reasonable time
- on-boarding is missing a tutorial
- not all game variants have been supplied with difficulty ratings yet
- calculation of next grid is not bullet proof in some rare circumstances

If someone sends you a Google Maps link, but you prefer using OpenStreetMap, you can share the link with Geo Share. The app will open it in an installed map app of your choice, such as OsmAnd or Organic Maps.

If you like finding places on Google Maps but prefer a different app for navigation, you can share the location from Google Maps with Geo Share. The app will open it in your favorite navigation app.

You can also use the app to copy Google Maps links as geo: links to your clipboard.

<b>How it works and privacy considerations</b>

Geo Share converts Google Maps links into geo: links that can be opened by other map apps. To create a geo: link, geographic coordinates are required. Geo Share parses them from the Google Maps URL.

However, not all Google Maps URLs include coordinates. In such cases, Geo Share will prompt you for permission to connect to Google and retrieve the coordinates from either HTTP headers or the HTML document of the link. For more detailed information, check the app's FAQ screen.

The time scale shows the units Eonothem, Erathem, Period, Epoch and Stage. It shows the begin of every period and if it is a GSSP. The time scale can be scrolled up and down if it does not fit on the screen. The view can be changed to fit the height of the display. Additionally, there is a true to scale option which sets the height of all periods according to its duration. You can select a period by touching it. Then, only the selected period and the subsequent periods are shown.

With the plus button it is possible to add a column with the more detailed unit at the right. The minus button removes the rightmost column. By sliding left or right, the view can be moved towards the more detailed or more coarse units.

There is also a search function which highlights the desired period.

GIF Live Wallpaper is what you need! Probably the easiest way to use a GIF file as a live wallpaper.

All this is done in a few simple steps:

Step 1 - Open the app 
Step 2 - Activate it.
Step 3 - Click ""Open GIF"".
Step 4 - Select the file you want.

If everything fits, that's it! Enjoy your new wallpaper!

The application stands out: 
- No need for root rights, small file size (<3MB)
- Stops automatically when the wallpaper is not visible or the device is locked, thereby not consuming battery power.
- And of course, no ads, and will not share your data or gather informations!

FAQ:
Q: Can I set a different GIF for the home screen and the lock screen?
A: Sorry, it's not possible: this is one of the limitation of Live Wallpapers, you can only apply to both. On some phones, they don't even run on lock screens!

Acquiring habits that stick can be difficult. Githo helps you by letting you gradually advance, instead of going from 0 to 100%.
This principle borrows ideas from exposure therapy.

Define levels of your final habit, going from easy to hard. Then start with the first one. Level up by consistently succeeding. If a level is too difficult (= if success isn't consistent), repeat the previous one.

Such a gradual acquisition <b>reduces the physical/mental strain</b> and helps you <b>create a routine long before arriving at the final habit</b>.


<strong>Example of a Habit-Plan:</strong>
Final Habit: <i>Go jogging every morning</i>
Levels: <i>Every morning...</i>
<b>* Week 1:</b> Just step outside on the street, then return home.
<b>* Week 2:</b> Take a walk around your house/building.
<b>* Week 3:</b> Take a walk spanning 3-5 buildings.
<b>* Week 4:</b> Take a longer walk and add short jogging-segments into the mix.
<b>* Week 5:</b> Go jogging. Well done.

A left swipe on the speedometer will show an altimeter instead.
When the START button is pressed travel distance is recorded (horizontal movement and also accumulated up and down movements).
A change is only recognized and added to the distance if the position changes by more than 2x GPS accuracy for horizontal
movement and 3x GPS accuracy for vertical movements and only if accuracy is at least 15m.
A flipped view for use as head-up display is also available.

A tile in quick settings allows you to enable/disable GPS lock.

A vital open-source testing tool for platform engineers, developers, and power users, GPSTest can also assist in understanding why your GPS/GNSS isn't working.

Supports dual-frequency* GNSS for:
• GPS (USA Navstar) (L1, L2, L3, L4, L5)
• Galileo (European Union) (E1, E5, E5a, E5b, E6)
• GLONASS (Russia) (L1, L2, L3, L5)
• QZSS (Japan) (L1, L2, L5, L6)
• BeiDou/COMPASS (China) (B1I, B2a, B2b, B3I)
• IRNSS/NavIC (India) (L1, L5, S)
• Various satellite-based augmentation systems SBAS (e.g., GAGAN, Anik F1, Galaxy 15, Inmarsat 3-F2, Inmarsat 4-F3, SES-5) (L1, L5)

*Dual-frequency GNSS requires device hardware support and Android 8.0 Oreo or higher. More at https://medium.com/@sjbarbeau/dual-frequency-gnss-on-android-devices-152b8826e1c.

The ""Accuracy"" feature lets you measure the error in your device's position against your *actual* location (entered by you). Other apps show you the *estimated* accuracy, which is generated by your device. GPSTest lets you to compare this estimated accuracy to *actual* accuracy!

Menu options:
• Inject Time Data - Injects Time assistance data for GPS into the platform, using information from a Network Time Protocol (NTP) server
• Inject PSDS Data - Injects Predicted Satellite Data Service (PSDS) assistance data for GNSS into the platform, using information from a PSDS server. Note that some devices don't use PSDS for assistance data - if this is your device, you'll see a message saying ""Platform does not support injecting PSDS data"". PSDS is the generic term for products like [XTRA assistance data](https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2007/02/qualcomm-introduces-gpsonextra-assistance-expand-capabilities-standalone).
• Clear Assist Data - Clears all assistance data used for GNSS, including NTP and XTRA data (Note: if you select this option to fix broken GNSS on your device, for GPS to work again you may need to ‘Inject Time’ and ‘Inject PSDS’ data. You may also see a large delay until your device acquires a fix again, so please use this feature with caution.)
• Settings - Switch between light and dark themes, change map tile type, auto-start GPS on startup, minimum time and distance between GPS updates, keep screen on.

Play with Asteroids Orbits. Physics.,"<p>The game demonstrates how the gravity force is working between the space objects.</p>
<p><br><b>Background from physics:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>The gravity force is getting bigger when the distance between the objects is decreasing, and the force is getting smaller when the distance is increasing.</li>
<li>The gravity force also depends on the mass of the space objects, so the objects with bigger mass create stronger gravity fields.</li>
</ol>

<p><br><b>Playing instructions:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>When you touch the screen with a finger, the touch point immediately becomes an object with mass.</li>
<li>It has much bigger mass than the freely flying asteroids and is visualized as a black hole.</li>
<li>The goal of each level is to collect 137 flying asteroids into the screen, using the gravity force of your finger.</li>
<li>During the play, you keep or move your finger on the screen and observe how the gravity force is moving the objects.</li>
<li>If you move your finger to cross the orbit of an asteroid you could see the effect of gravity force, which changes the direction and the speed of the asteroid.</li>
<li>After each level the asteroids become faster and the space they are flying in is increasing.</li>
</ol>

<p><br><b>Features:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Amazing graphical assets (asteroids, black holes and backgrounds) in 4 different color themes (purple, pink, green, red).</li>

<li>Supports different color palettes for different tastes.</li>

To this end you collect adventures in the diary on a rougly daily basis. The choice and language of the adventures should be consistent over time and the time between noting two subsequent adventures should not vary too much from one day.

After some time the app begins to choose adventures from the diary for mind testing. This choice is adaptive to your mind performance in such a way that you always can expect to have more positive than negative results.

The test results are amalgated into a single number, the ""mind index"". Its value is roughly the number of days you still remember your adventures rather well after.

The temporal graph of this mind index is displayed on the statistics page of the app.

The diary can be used to search, edit and remove adventures.

Offline first

I was frustrated with most of the story writing software I was finding as they were using web technologies (aka: Web Page in a box) which always seems to run into problems while being used offline for long periods of time. Hammer is designed from the ground up to be entirely local, no internet connection required, ever.

Intelligent Syncing between devices

Your data can be synchronized between devices allowing you to work on your story from anywhere, and have no fear of a change on one device, overwriting a change on another device.

Good range to aim for when charging a Li-ion battery is from about 40 to 80 percent in one go. A bunch of tiny charges throughout the day is your second best bet, and going from zero to 100 and then 100 to zero on a regular basis will put the most strain on your lithium-ion battery.

Healthy Battery Charging notifies you when to plug or unplug your phone from the charger in order to improve the battery life. The app itself is optimized for low battery consumption, running in the background and checking the battery level every 15 minutes. The exact timing of these checks depends on the Android OS, which might schedule them alongside other tasks or delay them when in sleep mode. As a result, the battery level may slightly exceed the high threshold while charging or drop slightly below the low threshold while discharging before you receive a notification.

The table below shows a common way to classify hearing loss

Degree of hearing loss:  dB HL range
Normal: –10 to 15
Slight: 16 to 25
Mild:   26 to 40
Moderate:   41 to 55
Moderately severe:  56 to 70
Severe: 71 to 90
Profound:   91+

First your earphones must be calibrated. You can either perform a full test which requires one or better several persons between the ages of 18 and 35 with normal hearing. Or you can perform a simple calibration at 1000Hz only (assuming good hearing at this frequency). In this case it is assumed that the earphones are linear across the frequency range and calibration values for the other frequencies are then calculated using the ISO226:2003 standard. Whenever you hear a beep simply touch the screen.  You can pause / continue with a long click and speed up with a double click. If you have several persons available for calibration simply press ""Add Calibration"" and an average value of existing calibrations will be calculated. You may also delete the whole calibration.

After that you can perform tests and view them in test results.

You can then also perform tests at single frequencies. There you can manually select ear, frequency, and sound amplitude by clicking on the buttons.

- Display of the file in hexadecimal (or plain text) with the possibility to modify the content (in hexadecimal only).
- Saving the file on the smartphone/tablet (2).
- Search option in the open file (hexadecimal and plain text modes).

(1) At first, the file can only be saved via ""save as"" and due to Android permissions reasons, the only way to make it appear in the list of recent files is to reopen it.
(2) Due to file permissions, after a ""save as"", the list of recent files cannot be updated with the new file location.

Caution: Opening files that are too large seriously degrades application performance and can suddenly stop the application on low-resource devices.

**WARNING:** This application cannot open files larger than ~20 MB on recent smartphones and less for older smartphones.

Its aim is to help navigation for walkers/hikers (hence the name) and other outdoor users. For example, imagine you are entering a large field and it's not clear where the exit is. Hikar will overlay the course of the footpath on your phone's camera feed helping you to navigate across the field. Or, you're at a junction of paths and it's not clear which is the correct way. Hikar will show a virtual signpost, showing the direction and distance of nearby points of interest such as villages, hills, mountains or pubs. Or, you're having to make your way across a pathless moor. Again, Hikar will help you find the way.

Hikar covers the whole of Europe, plus Turkey. It could potentially work in any area which uses Roman, Greek or Cyrillic characters, but the Hikar server (also FLOSS software: see gitlab.com/nickw1/freemap-api) currently only contains data for the specified areas.
Note that Hikar is a research project and therefore, while perfectly usable for navigation it is not a 'polished' app with a really nice UI and, like many AR apps, can use a lot of battery power.

Please note, that for a currently-unknown reason, Hikar will not run on the Amazon Fire HD 10 (and possibly other Amazon Fire devices).

Many thanks to my colleague Neil Brewis for providing the signpost assets.

- No search history is stored locally or remotely by this app (last search term is cached in memory only) but it may or may not be possible that your search is tracked by the selected translation provider
- No client-side JavaScript is executed
- HTTPS communication between app and translation providers

<b>Please be extra cautious to not share sensitive data (passwords etc.) with translation providers by accident! If you're using the floating button don't trigger a translation if sensitive data is located in the system clipboard.</b>

Tips and Tricks:
- If an app has implemented a custom context menu see if the floating button works for you or if the app is able to share text
- Integration into ""Librera"" (FOSS ebook reader):
   1. Select any word in the document by long-pressing it (text selection must be supported by the document)
   2. In the opening dialog tap the ""+"" sign at the bottom and select InstaLate
   3. Next time you select text you'll have access to the InstaLate button at the bottom

With this App you'll be able to select which information you'd like to share with other profiles on the same device. Notifications about the shared data will be shown in the other profiles allowing you to download, share or copy it from the profile the data is located in.

In order to support the user during his training, the app provides stopwatches, which can be configured according to the user’s own training and resting phases. In addition, the app reminds the user of previously defined training sessions via a notification.

To check the user’s goals and to recognize training progress, the app offers the possibility to retrieve statistics about the training times and the calories burned in a daily, weekly or monthly overview.

This app is part of the Privacy Friendly Apps group
developed by the research group SECUSO at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology.

How does Privacy Friendly Interval Timer differ from other similar apps?

1) Minimal permissions
Privacy Friendly Internval Timer requires the persmission ""Run at startup"" to automatically restart the motivation notifications when the phone reboots.

For comparison: The Top Ten similar apps from the Google Play Store, require an average of 9,1 permissions (September 2017). These are for instance the permission to access accounts, permissions to access, modify or delete storage and access to networks or the internet.

2) No advertisement
Moreover, Privacy Friendly Ludo distinguishes from many other applications in the way that it completely relinquishes advertisements. Advertisement might track a user's actions. It could also shorten battery life or use mobile data.

<i>InviZible Pro</i> includes the well known modules <b>DNSCrypt, Tor and Purple I2P</b>. These modules are used to achieve maximum security, privacy and ease of use of the Internet.

<i>InviZible Pro</i> can use root, if your device has root privileges, or uses a local VPN to deliver Internet traffic to Tor, DNSCrypt and I2P networks.

<b>Features:</b>

* No root required
* Hides location and IP
* Unblocks the restricted web content
* Prevents tracking
* Allows access to hidden networks
* ARP spoofing detection
* Built-in firewall
* Tethering supported
* Material design theme

Just start <i>InviZible Pro,</i> and you turn from a simple user to an invisible one, who is very difficult to find, block or impose unnecessary products and services in the form of ubiquitous advertising on.

However, if you want to get full control over the program and your Internet connection - no problem! <i>InviZible Pro</i> provides access to a large number of both simple and professional settings. You can easily configure <i>InviZible Pro</i> itself, as well as its modules - <b>DNSCrypt, Tor and Purple I2P,</b> to satisfy the most non-standard requirements.

<i>InviZible Pro</i> is an all-in-one program. After installing it, you can easily delete all of your VPN applications and ad blockers. In most cases, <i>InviZible Pro</i> works better, is more stable, and faster than free VPNs. It does not contain ads, bloatware and does not spy upon its users.

<i>InviZible Pro</i> blocks ipv6 due to some security issues with this protocol and the InviZible app.

So what are those three modules, and what do they achieve?


<b>DNSCrypt</b>

DNS is used by most applications to translate domain names into IP addresses to find a remote server with the site that you want to visit. But this communication is not encrypted and can be used by attackers. DNSCrypt encrypts and authenticates DNS traffic, thus preventing DNS tracking and spoofing.

* Encrypts DNS requests
* Protects against DNS spoofing
* Blocks ads¹
* Protects against dangerous and phishing sites¹
* Can block ""adult"" sites¹
* Hides visited sites from your provider
* Prevents some types of resource locks

¹ Depending on the selected dnscrypt server


<b>Tor</b>

Tor encrypts Internet traffic and hides your actual location. It uses thousands of computers around the world to mask your IP address and prevents activity tracking to preserve your privacy and anonymity. Tor also provides access to onion services. These are sites that are in a completely hidden network without censorship.

* Encrypts Internet traffic
* Prevents sites locking
* Can provide privacy and anonymity
* Provides access to ""onion"" sites


<b>Purple I2P</b>

The Invisible Internet Project (I2P) is a hidden anonymous network. It includes thousands of computers distributed around the world. Purple I2P encrypts the traffic of your device and sends it through these computers to ensure privacy and anonymity. Start I2P to access I2P sites and other Invisible Internet hidden services.

* Encrypts Internet traffic
* Provides access to the hidden anonymous network Invisible Internet and ""i2p"" sites

- Slang is the use of informal words and expressions that are not considered standard in the speaker's dialect or language.

- In addition to jargon, you will also find a large number of indigenous and old Spanish elements, as is the case in the department of Tolima.

- Jergas Colombia will always be at your fingertips without requiring internet.

- If you are a resident you will be able to understand locals from other regions of Colombia.

It is possible to write the points at the Schieber, Coiffeur, Differenzler, Molotov and other Jass types. 


*************************

For all boards it is possible to have several profiles. Settings and scores are stored independently. For example, you don't have to delete an unfinished round to be able to play Jass with other players. Even if different rules are used depending on the composition, this can easily be solved by a profile.

The current profile can be shared by AndroidBeam (NFC) simply with another device. For this the board of one device has to be open and the devices have to be held back to back. This is helpful, for example, when the battery is empty or when complex profile settings have to be made.

*************************

Schieber panel:
- Write points individually (1/20/50/100) for Weis,...
- Write complete rounds incl. multiplier (1x-7x) and opponent points
- Input dialog can be rotated (for 1 or 2 writers)
- Individual entries or complete rounds can be undone.
- Different number of target points possible
- Adjustable score per round (e.g. for double cards 314)
- Extensive statistics
- Backside to write down strokes for wins/matches,...

Coiffeur board:
- The types of jass can be chosen according to your preferences.
- 16 predefined jass types + the possibility to enter your own (without picture).
- The number of rounds played can be between 6 and 12.
- It can be written for 2 or 3 teams.
- Multipliers can be changed manually if desired.
- Statistics about achievable points as well as conditions how a team becomes unreachable.
- If a team is unreachable, this will be displayed.

Differenzler board:
- 2-8 players
- Announcements remain hidden until the first points have been entered.
- Points from the last outstanding player are automatically calculated.
- Points from the last round can be changed afterwards (long press).

Molotov board:
- 2-8 players
- Writing Weis in 3 clicks
- When writing rounds, the outstanding points are calculated automatically.
- Points can be edited later (long press)
- Points can be written exactly or rounded.

Score board:
This is a general score board, which should allow you to write many more types of Jass.
- 2-8 players
- Target points / number of rounds can be set
- In order to be able to write faster, the number of points per round can be set. (Outstanding points are calculated automatically).

The JMP eSIM Adapter is a removable eSIM chip that enables any device, not just those with included eSIM chips, to make use of downloadable eSIMs.

JMP SIM Manager provides management features such as adding, deleting, enabling, and disabling eSIM profiles for the adapter, and is the easiest option to manage your eSIM Adapter on compatible Android host devices. The manager app is <strong>not</strong> required once a profile has been downloaded and enabled on the adapter. In other words, you can use a compatible Android device to download your eSIM profile of choice onto the adapter, and then insert the adapter into any device -- Wi-Fi hotspots, dumb phones, laptops -- and the adapter will simply appear as a regular SIM card to those devices.

This app also includes a quick compatibility check to determine whether your Android device can be used to manage a JMP eSIM Adapter. Although the eSIM Adapter will work with almost any device once an eSIM profile is loaded, management requires some specific features that may not be present on a small percentage of Android devices. However, even if your Android device is deemed incompatible, you can still manage the adapter from another Android device, using a PC/SC reader on a PC, or, as a final fallback, through the SIM Toolkit menu along with a self-hostable remote server to handle TLS termination.",1

Programmer's calculator based on Emmet Gray's WRPN 16c, which simulates
an HP 16c.  This is an RPN-based calculator that works in floating point,
and integers expressed in hex, decimal, octal or binary.  I modified Emmet's 
WRPN (with permission) so that it uses rendered fonts for the keys. This 
makes them look nice and crisp on high resolution displays.

<b>iCal standard compliant</b>
Using the iCal standard ensures compatibility and interoparability with other apps and services independent of a dedicated provider or infrastructure. Journals and Notes are compliant to the definition of the VJOURNAL component, Tasks are compliant to the VTODO component. Future features will also include import and export functionalities to and from .ics files :-)

<b>Combine journals, notes & tasks</b>
Instead of using separate apps for journals, notes & tasks you can use them out of one hand, combine and link them to each other, e.g. create meeting minutes and link your tasks to them.

<b>Sync with DAVx5 (coming soon)</b>
Synchronize your entries with any compatible CalDAV server by using DAVx5. By using DAVx5 you are free to choose your preferred provider for CalDAV, you can even use your local server to store and synchronize your data.
Note: DAVx5 is an independent app and must be acquired separately.

<b>Open Source</b>
Your data can contain private and sensitive data by their nature. We believe that individuals and companies should be able to be in full control of their own data. This means the freedom to choose where and how the data are stored, and freedom in choice of software. That is why we chose DAVx5 as a Sync Adapter to synchronise your data between your phone and any compatible CalDAV-server. The source code for jtx Board is publically available - find out more on https://jtx.techbee.at !

<i>What does VJournal and VTodo mean?</i>
VJournal and VTodo are calendar components defined in the international standard RFC-5545, the Internet Calendaring and Scheduling Core Object Specification (iCalendar), see https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5545 . This standard also defines the VEvent component, which is the standard definition for calendar event entries. jtx Board is using the VJournal component according to this iCalendar standard for journal entries and tasks. VJournals can have a defined start date, but they cannot have a duration or an end date. VJournals with a defined start date are considered journals entries in jtx Board, VJournals without start date are interpreted as notes. The VTodo component as defined in the iCalendar standard defines the technical specification of tasks, which can have a scheduled start, due and completed date as well as a progress and a completed status (amongst others).

The VEvent definition is widely used, the VTodo component also found some implementations in Apps, but the VJournal component remained in the dark almost not being implemented at all by other apps and services. With jtx Board we would like to revive the usage of this standard and empower it with the possibilities to link and combine VTodos with VJournals - and in the future also VEvents! :-)

it can be challenging to read small numbers when just waking up. Big

Intended to be used as a failsafe for those living alone in case of an accident or other emergency. Once the settings are configured, no further interaction is required.

- 100% Device-based, no cloud services or accounts required
- Free with no ads or trackers
- Open Source (https://github.com/keepalivedev/KeepAlive)
- Minimal Battery Usage
- Multiple SMS Recipients
- Custom Alert Message
- Optional: Include Location Information in SMS
- Optional: Place a phone call with speakerphone enabled
- Optional: Send an HTTP request to a custom URL

Requirements
  Keep Alive requires that your device has an active cellular plan.  WiFi calling and messaging will be used if the device supports it.

How it Works
  Keep Alive uses either your device's lock screen or another app(s) to detect activity. If your device hasn't been lock or unlocked for a set period of time, or if you haven't accessed the selected app(s), you will be prompted with an 'Are you there?' notification. If this notification is not acknowledged an Alert will be triggered. Based on the configured Emergency Contact Settings, one or more SMS messages and/or a phone call will be placed to notify others that you may be in need of assistance.

Main Settings
- Monitoring Method - Choose between using the lock screen or another app(s) to detect activity. If using another app(s), you will be prompted to select the app(s) to monitor.
- Hours of Inactivity Before Prompt - how many hours since your phone was last locked or unlocked before you are prompted with an 'Are you there?' notification. Defaults to 12 hours
- Minutes to Wait - if the prompt is not acknowledged within this time, an Alert will be sent based on the configured emergency contact settings. Defaults to 60 minutes
- Rest Period Time Range - a range of time during which inactivity will not be counted. For example, with 'Hours of Inactivity' set at 6 hours and a Rest Period of 22:00 – 6:00, if the device is last used at 18:00, the 'Are you there?' check would not be sent until 8:00.  Note that an alert can still be sent during a rest period if the 'Are you there?' check was sent BEFORE the start of a rest period.
- Auto-Restart Monitoring After Alert - If enabled, monitoring will be automatically restarted after an Alert is sent.
- Alert Webhook - Configure an HTTP request to be sent when an Alert is triggered

Emergency Contact Settings
- Phone Call Number (Optional) - when an Alert is triggered a phone call will be placed to this number with speakerphone enabled

One or more SMS recipients can be configured with:
- Phone Number - the phone number to send the Alert SMS to
- Alert Message - the message that will be sent when an Alert is triggered
- Include Location - if enabled, your location will be included in a second SMS

Privacy/Data Collection
No data is collected other than the configured settings.  This data is not shared with the developers or any 3rd parties. The only data transmitted is to the configured emergency contacts. This app does not request network or storage access and no data is sent to the developers or any 3rd parties.

Disclaimer
- Not responsible for SMS or phone call charges incurred by the use of the Keep Alive app
- The operation of the Keep Alive app is dependent on the device, software, and network connectivity. The developers are not responsible for any failure due to device malfunctions, software incompatibilities, or network issues.",1

It can also be used to ensure a connection with a timeout will be kept alive.

<b>Features</b>

- Create multiple separate network tasks
- One task monitors one network service at a specified interval
- A task sends a specified number of pings, performs a specified number of connections attempts or downloads a file or a site
- Successful and unsuccessful attempts are logged
- Downloaded files can automatically be deleted after a successful download or be kept
- Notifications can be sent on failure or when a network service goes down or up
- A network task can be restricted to WiFi connections, i.e. it does not perform any action on mobile networks with potentially limited download data
- The configuration can be exported and imported as a JSON data file
- Intervals can be defined during which all background work is suspended for battery saving

<b>Permissions</b>
- <i>RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED</i> for restarting running networks tasks on device boot
- <i>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE</i> for checking network accessibility
- <i>INTERNET</i> for accessing the internet
- <i>WAKE_LOCK</i> to keep the device awake while executing a task
- <i>FOREGROUND_SERVICE</i> to start the foreground service for running tasks
- <i>USE_EXACT_ALARM</i> to start networks tasks after expiry of intervals (Android 13+)
- <i>SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM</i> to start networks tasks after expiry of intervals (Android 11 and 12)
- <i>POST_NOTIFICATIONS</i> for sending notifications

<b>Note</b>
The app works best if you disable battery optimization. If battery optimization is active, network tasks execution may be unreliable especially for short intervals, i.e. they may trigger less often and the trigger time may not be exact. There is a link in the app leading to the Android battery settings for the app. Of course, with disabled battery optimization power consumption may be higher.

What can be remapped?

 * Volume buttons.
 * Power button, side key, and voice assistant button (one time purchase to support development).
 * Bluetooth/wired keyboards.
 * Fingerprint gestures on supported devices.
 * DPAD buttons on game controllers.
 * Buttons on other connected devices should also work.

You can combine multiple keys from a specific device or any device to form a ""trigger"". Each trigger can have multiple actions. The keys can be set to be pressed at the same time or one after another in a sequence. Keys can be remapped when they are short pressed, long pressed or double pressed. A keymap can have a set of ""constraints"" so it only has an effect in certain situations.

What can’t be remapped?
 * Mouse buttons
 * Thumb sticks or triggers on game controllers

Your key maps do not work if the screen is OFF. This is a limitation in Android. There is nothing the dev can do.

What can I remap my keys to do?
Some actions will only work on rooted devices and specific Android versions.

There are too many features to list here so check out the full list here: https://docs.keymapper.club/user-guide/actions

Permissions
You don't have to grant all the permissions for the app to work. The app will tell you if a permission needs to be granted for a feature to work.

 * Accessibility Service: Basic requirement for remapping to work. It is needed so the app can listen to and block key events.
 * Device Admin: To turn the screen off when using the action to turn off the screen.
 * Modify System Settings: To change the brightness and rotation settings.
 * Camera: To control the flashlight.

 On some devices, enabling the accessibility service will disable ""enhanced data encryption"".

Keyoxide allows you to prove “ownership” of accounts on websites, domain names, IM, etc., regardless of your username.

That last part is important: you could, for example, be ‘alice’ on Lobste.rs, but ‘@alice24’ on Twitter.
And if your website is ‘thatcoder.tld’, how are people supposed to know that all that online property is yours?

Of course, one could opt for full anonymity! In which case, keep these properties as separated as possible.
But if you’d like these properties to be linked and, by doing so, establish an online identity, you’ll need a clever solution.

Enter Keyoxide.

When you visit someone’s Keyoxide profile and see a green tick next to an account on some website,
it was proven beyond doubt that the same person who set up this profile also holds that account.

About the concept and name:

An antiquated form of memory aid. The basic idea is that you tie a knot in the corner of your handkerchief the night before you have to perform some task. When you go to blow your nose or wipe your face or perform any of the other actions associated with a handkerchief you will see the knot and remember your duty.

Problems arise, however, when it comes to recalling precisely what it is you are supposed to remember. Also, with the rise of the paper tissue, and the decline of the handkerchief, this practice has fallen out of use. Nowadays it is far easier to use a memo app on your mobile phone.

Breaking of end-to-end encryption (E2EE) by laws such as the planned EU chat control is an ongoing issue. Content in messengers that use E2EE, such as Whatsapp or Signal, could thus be monitored by third parties. E2EE is often, but not always, standard in messengers. There are proven methods for E2EE such as PGP. However, these methods are sometimes cumbersomely integrated and require a lot of effort to use.

KryptEY is an Android keyboard that implements the Signal protocol. The keyboard works messenger-independently and both the X3DH Key Agreement Protocol and the Double Ratchet Algorithm work without a server, thus it enables a highly independent use of the protocol.

<b>Features</b>
Based upon Simple Keyboard ( https://github.com/rkkr/simple-keyboard ), KryptEY adds a view above the Keyboard for the E2EE functionality.

* use E2EE through Signal Protocol in any messenger
* encryption/decryption of messages
* enter message through separate text field in keyboard
* use clipboard to read messages
* manage contacts in own contact list in keyboard
* message log to view sent/received messages
* send messages as plain JSON (raw mode) or hidden in a decoy text (fairytale mode)
* verification of E2EE functionality via fingerprint
* Q&A View for questions
* dark & light theme

See https://github.com/amnesica/KryptEY/blob/master/KRYPTEY.md for further information on how KryptEY is working.

<b>Security</b>
The existing security properties for the Signal Protocol are also valid for the keyboard.

<b>Limitations</b>
The keyboard was designed as a POC and only allows 1-to-1 conversations. However, the application can also be used in a group chat to a limited extent. Here, a message can be directed to a specific chat partner and not to all people. Other participants of the group chat cannot decrypt the message.

Text messages in Telegram are getting copied as HTML and not as plain text. When decoding the message with the fairytale mode the copied message is compromised and can't be read properly. Therefore, it can't be decoded at all. However, the raw mode works properly. When using KryptEY with Telegram we recommend the raw mode.

Some messengers like Threema only allows up to 3500 bytes per message. Therefore, different character input limitations apply. To stay under the 3500 bytes limit, only 500 characters are allowed for raw and fairytale mode. For convenience these limitation applies for all messengers.

<b>Demo</b>
For a demonstration on how KryptEY is used see https://github.com/amnesica/KryptEY/tree/master#demo 

KryptEY was created by mellitopia and amnesica. The code is open source and can be found at https://github.com/amnesica/KryptEY

It is an efficient and fast input method editor, suitable for electronic touchscreen devices.

筷字输入法 (Kuaizi IME) abandones the traditional method of tapping on virtual keyboard keys one by one, it instead offers a swipe input method for Pinyin, combined with the combinatorial features of Pinyin letters. The key layout is designed to make Pinyin input more accurate and convenient.

筷字输入法 (Kuaizi IME) provides editing support such as cursor movement and text selection for the target editor, thereby eliminating the frustration of being unable to accurately position inputs and text due to the small screen size of mobile devices. This further enhances text input and editing efficiency on small-screen devices.

User-data generated by 筷字输入法 (Kuaizi IME) is stored locally. It does not connect to the internet and will not collect nor analyze user data or behavior habits. Furthermore, it does not support or provide predictive input nor fuzzy matching mechanisms. To some extent, this input method editor aims to enhance the users' ability to recognize and memorize Chinese characters and Pinyin, ensuring that the reliance on digital tools does not lead to the gradual forgetting and eventual abandonment of 「汉字」(Hànzì, Chinese characters), a treasure of Chinese civilization.

The KUKSA framework is based on the COVESA Vehicle Signal Specification (VSS).

The VSS defines the names and semantics of a large set of data entries that represent the current and/or intended state of a vehicle's sensors and actuators organized in a tree-like structure. For example, the vehicle's current speed is represented by the Vehicle.Speed entry.

However, VSS does not define how these signals are to be collected and managed within a vehicle, nor does it prescribe how other components in the vehicle can read or write signal values from and to the tree.

The KUKSA Databroker is a resource efficient implementation of the VSS signal tree and is intended to be run within a vehicle on a microprocessor based platform. It allows applications in the vehicle to interact with the vehicle's sensors and actuators using a uniform, high level gRPC API for querying signals, updating current and target values of sensors and actuators and getting notified about changes to signals of interest.

Showcases covered by the Companion App are:

- Door Control
- Temperature Control
- Light Control
- Tire Pressure Check

It allows you to record sensor readings, procedures, and observations in a structured and organized way. Each entry is automatically timestamped, ensuring accurate and tamper-proof records.

In addition to text and numeric values, LabLog enables the storage of images, which can be particularly useful for later analysis—something paper notebooks can’t provide. The app differentiates itself by associating each entry with specific data keys, making it easier to categorize, search, and filter entries based on the type of information stored.

LabLog is ideal for laboratories equipped with IoT sensors that automatically measure and send data to a server. The app can also send manual entries to the same server using the MQTT protocol, ensuring that human-recorded data is securely stored alongside automated sensor readings.

This approach improves both the transparency and reliability of laboratory data. For example, when using analog pH strips, a lab technician can manually input the pH reading into LabLog and send it to the server with other sensor data, ensuring a unified and secure record-keeping system.

The key features of LaundryNotes include the ability to add any clothing or fabric item to the app, entering washing instructions based on the symbols found on the label or packaging of your garment, the option to add a reference photo for identifying the item, the option to add custom notes for additional information, the option to organize items into categories, and the search function to find items by category or name.

The interface of the app has been designed to be simple and intuitive. To add a new item, simply click on the ""+"" button and fill out the form with the desired information. To view or modify an existing item, simply click on it in the list. To delete an item, press and hold the symbol to open the deletion menu.

The service is a completely free public service. No user account or personal information required. It's simply our way ensuring you no longer have any excuse to let anyone log and bog you (down with ads).

<b>Why should you use the Lavabit Encrypted Proxy?</b>

* We do not record anything about how you use the Internet
* We do not invade your display with ads
* We do not sell, give or share your data with anyone
* We do not have any limits on how much or how fast you can download
* We do not require a user account
* We do not charge anything for this free service
* We use fully encrypted physical servers to provide you with the best service
• We safely mask IPv4 and IPv6 traffic
* We use strong encryption to provide PERFECT FORWARD SECRECY for your surfing sessions.

<b>How does Lavabit Encrypted Proxy work?</b>

With the <i>Lavabit Encrypted Proxy,</i> we use Virtual Private Networking (VPN) technology to provide an encrypted pipeline for all your Internet traffic. It's a secure tunnel between your computer and the Internet backbone. Right past any peepers that might be up to no good. From our servers, you can access the Internet without censorship, or surveillance. What's more, the websites and servers you access will no longer see your identity, or rather your IP address, but will instead see the generic proxy address we provide.

Using a <i>Lavabit Encrypted Proxy</i> is a great first step toward protecting your privacy, and taking backing control over what personal information you share, and with whom.

Note, both the app and backend services have been built using F/OSS software, however this specific app variant is tied specifically to the VPN servers operated by Lavabit.

Furthermore, the app has all the usual functions of an OPAC.

Features:

- Tested with 200 public and academic libraries in Germany, Switzerland, and Austria.
- Supports 20 different kinds of OPACs from different vendors out of the box.
- Custom XPath expressions can be entered in the app to select any data from any website, so any library can be added without compiling the app.
- It shows all borrowed books from all library cards from different libraries in a single list, so you can always see which book needs to be returned next.
- The list of borrowed books can be sorted by the due date, lending date, lending library, author, title, and other criteria.
- The notification about a dooming due date is more reliable than reminder emails sent by the library OPAC since you can never know if an email actually arrives in time. VideLibri on the other hand stores all data on your smartphone, so the due date is always already there and does not need to arrive.
- Renewing of borrowed books, manually or automatically before the due date to extend the lending period.
- History of all borrowed books, so you can always look back at the books you had borrowed in the past, even after the books were returned to the library and are not shown anymore in the library OPAC.
- Turing-complete XQuery search in the history that can answer arbitrary complex queries, like which borrowed book had the longest title and was borrowed more than once? 
- Search in the OPAC for non-lent books as well as ordering and reserving of non-lent books in some libraries.
- Developed since the year 2006, it is the world's first universal library app and any other library app is a VideLibri copycat.
- Open-source



Some larger public libraries that were tested successfully are for example in the cities Augsburg, GGG Basel, Berlin, Bielefeld, Cologne, Düsseldorf, Lübeck, or Linz, or Munich.

The entire list of all tested libraries and OPACs is too long for the app store page, but you can find it at https://videlibri.de/bibliotheken.html . 


The Android part of VideLibri has been translated into English. However, since most libraries in the list are German, they have German books with German titles. Additional resources like documentation and changelog written for the original VideLibri Windows app in 2006 remain in German. The Windows and Linux app are currently being translated.

Supports Android 1.0+

It allows you to play audio and video files, like how you expected to. Most importantly it is designed in hope to make it compatible with different Android versions.
Its usage is as easy as opening or sharing the file you want to play with the app, or selecting it directly from the app. Enjoy your music!
Note that this project was originally known as simple music player.

Currently partially support m3u/m3u8 playlist files. More information below in section Playlist Support.

You can find most information about Little Music Player just below.

Different variations

- Tiny Music Player https://github.com/martinmimigames/tiny-music-player
  Smallest, most minimal, with the trade-off of only having the most basic features.


Playlist support

- Folder-based playlist on Android 5.0+
- Temporary playlist via multi-share function
- Partial m3u/m3u8 support

m3u/m3u8 features supported:
- Audio stream url (http/https)
- Absolute audio path (e.g. /storage/emulated/0/Music/Example.mp3)
- Nested m3u/m3u8 files (Absolute path only)
- Custom audio name via ""#EXTINF: [duration], [custom name]"" , does not support duration

Features

- It's free
  Everyone should have the right to listen to music, therefore we aim to make it accessible.

- No advertisement
  We simply want a distraction-free experience for you, so you can relax and enjoy!

- Compact
  Less than half a MB in size, one of the tiniest audio player apps on Android! No need to worry about bloated apps again. (Currently less than 30 KB)

- Unbelievably compatible
  Strangely addicted to support, we believe that nobody should be excluded due to an older device. Therefore we have theoretical support starting all the way back from Android 1.0, and tested support on Android 2.3 and above. Isn't it amazing?

- Clean & Simple
  No awkward layout, no hidden options and straightforward, so you can focus on the content. Enjoyment is key, right?

- It simply works :)
  Even in the modern world, there is always something seeming to fail. Luckily for you, this app was designed to work just like it is supposed to. It supports all audio types that your device supports.

- Minimal permissions required
  Have you ever met an app asking for a bunch of unrelated permissions? Have you ever had some strange requests reminding you of a malware? Not this app! We will explain how we use all our permissions, so you know it's safe to use.

- No hidden third-parties
  It is completely open-source, and uses as little third-party libraries as possible.

If you worry about size, compatibility or privacy, this is the best app for you!

We use the foreground service permission to provide audio playing while using other apps.
We use the notification permission for displaying playback control, as we are mainly a notification
based music player.
We use the internet permission to allow for audio streaming, however such function is still being
developed, and can be very buggy.
We use the read storage/audio/video permission to open the audio files. Required for older devices, and m3u/m3u8 processing.

(Beta function)
Share a url containing a media file to Little Music Player to stream it.
Or use a m3u file with the stream url inside.

From this a database of emitter locations is created.
When UnifiedNlp / microG request a location from Local NLP Backend, a scan for nearby emitter is initiated and a location determined based on the scan results.
Local NLP Backend is a fork of the Déjà Vu NLP Backend with some improvements and a crude UI for configuration and importing / exporting data, including cell lists from MLS or OpenCelliD.

This backend uses no network data. All data acquired by the phone stays on the phone, though it may be exported manually.

How to use:
Local NLP Backend can be used like Déjà Vu: just enable the backend and let it build up the database by frequently having GPS enabled, e.g. using a map app.
If you have a Déjà Vu database (you'll need root privileged to extract it), it can be imported in Local NLP Backend. Further import options are databases exported by Local NLP Backend, and cell csv files from MLS or OpenCelliD.
Note that the local database needs to be filled, either using GPS or by importing data, before Local NLP Backend can provide locations!

In order to speed up building the database, LocalNLP has an optional active mode that enabled GPS when there is no known emitter nearby (low setting) or when any unknown emitter is found (aggressive setting).

This backend consists of two parts sharing a common database. One part passively
monitors the GPS. If the GPS has acquired and has a good position accuracy, then
the WiFi APs detected by the phone are stored.

The other part is the actual location provider which uses the database to
estimate location when the GPS is not available or has not yet gotten its first
fix. The use of stored WiFi AP can dramatically decrease the GPS time to first
fix.

This backend performs no network data. All data acquired by the phone stays on
the phone and no queries are made to a centralized AP location provider.

Detailed charts and statistics give you a clear picture of how your habits have improved over time. The app is completely ad-free, open source and it respects your privacy.

<b>Beautiful, minimalistic and lightweight interface</b>
Loop has an elegant and minimalistic interface that is very easy to use, even for first-time users. Highly optimized for speed, the app works well even on older phones.

<b>Habit score</b>
Loop has an advanced formula for calculating the strength of your habits. Every repetition makes your habit stronger and every missed day makes it weaker. A few missed days after a long streak, however, will not completely destroy your progress, unlike many other don't-break-the-chain apps.

<b>Flexible schedules</b>
In addition to daily habits, Loop supports habits with more complex schedules, such as 3 times per week or every other day.

<b>Reminders</b>
Schedule notifications to remind you of your habits. Each habit can have its own reminder, at a chosen time of the day. Easily check or dismiss your habit directly from the notification.

<b>Widgets</b>
Be reminded of your habits whenever you unlock your phone. Colorful widgets allow you to track your habits directly from your home screen, without even opening the app.

<b>Take control of your data</b>
If you want to further analyze your data, or move it to another service, Loop allows you to export it to spreadsheets (CSV) or to a database file (SQLite). For power users, checkmarks can be added through other apps, such as Tasker.

<b>No limitations</b>
Track as many habits as you wish. Loop imposes no artificial limits on how many habits you can have. All features are available to all users. There are no in-app purchases.

<b>Completely ad-free and open source</b>
There are no advertisements, annoying notifications or intrusive permissions in this app, and there will never be. The app is completely open-source (GPLv3).

<b>Works offline and respects your privacy</b>
Loop doesn't require an Internet connection or online account registration. Your confidential data is never sent to anyone. Neither the developers nor any third-parties have access to it.

* Account setup and done. Settings invite feature creep and its friend unmaintainability. There is one specific work flow. K-9 Mail or FairEmail is more suitable for others.
* Minimal dependencies. Only widely known, highly tested libraries from reputable vendors. Third-party libraries are often of poor quality, and end up unmaintained.
* First class Autocrypt. Ltt.rs fits right into its strict UX guidelines.
* Based on jmap-mua, a headless e-mail client, or a library that handles everything an e-mail client would, aside from data storage and UI. There is also lttrs-cli, which uses the same library.
* Looks to Gmail for inspiration in cases of uncertainty.

1. No permissions
Privacy Friendly Ludo does not require any permissions.

2. No advertisement
Moreover, Privacy Friendly Ludo distinguishes from many other applications in the way that it completely relinquishes advertisements. Advertisement might track a user's actions. It could also shorten battery life or use mobile data.

* For support for this application please open an issue at our GitLab repository ( https://gitlab.com/gateship-one/malp ).

This application works with every mpd above version 0.14 but to get the best performance and features we recommend to use at least version 0.15 (for playlist performance). Consider updating to the newest version.

This application has workarounds for Mopidy, it may or may not work. No support for Mopidy, as this is an MPD client.

If you don't know MPD and are looking for a music player for android, we recommend you have a look into Odyssey, which shares the same user interface with this application. ( https://f-droid.org/packages/org.gateshipone.odyssey/ )

The client implements most of the daemons functionality so that full media control and management is possible.


To filter albums this client uses the album artist tag (if available) to filter multiple albums with the same title (e.g. Greatest Hits)

We recommend that your music is tagged with musicbrainz library to get the best experience as the data tags are used to fetch artwork for artists and albums. 

Features:
 * Artist/Album/Files, saved playlist library browsing
 * AlbumArtist filtering
 * MBID filtering (multiple albums with same AlbumArtist and title can be accessed separately if MusicBrainzID is available)
 * Local  & server-based search
 * Basic playlist management (add songs to saved lists, remove songs from saved lists, remove lists, save lists)
 * Launcher widget
 * Optional notification (enable in settings)
 * Background volume control via hardware buttons (only with notification enabled)
 * Multiple server profiles
 * Server statistics (use this to request a database update)
 * Output control
 * Artwork support with MusicBrainz,Last.fm, Fanart.tv as artwork provider (Album, artist images)
 * Fanart view for tablets or stuff like that (click on the cover in the now playing view, or select fullscreen mode from menu), best used on widescreen devices in landscape mode.

The game models a conflict between two groups:
    - an informed minority (the mafiosi or the werewolves) 
    - an uninformed majority (the villagers)
At the start of the game, each player is secretly assigned a role affiliated with one of these teams.
The game has two alternating phases:
    - day-phase
    - night-phase
during which those with night-killing-powers may covertly kill other players,
and second, a day-phase, in which all surviving players debate and vote to eliminate a suspect.
The game continues until a faction achieves its win-condition;

An Introduction to Non-Aristotelian Systems and ,"<b>Manhood of Humanity, Second Edition A. Korzybski</b>

This work began with a functional definition of <b>'man'</b>, formulated in 1921, based on an analysis of uniquely human potentials; specifically, that each generation can start where the previous one left off. I called this characteristic the <b>'time-binding'</b> capacity .... We no longer have to blind ourselves to the old dogmas about the <b>'immutability of human nature'</b> because we have discovered that we <b>can change it</b>. We should realize our human potentials so that we can go to the future with some hope. Alfred Korzybski.

<b>General Semantics (GS)</b> was developed by Alfred Korzybski, a Polish engineer who settled in the United States after World War I. The death and destruction of war horrified him and prompted him to search for an answer to the question of how humans have been able to advance technologically so far, yet are unable to put their relationships in order. After researching this question for more than a decade, he formulated a general semantics, which he presented most fully in his book Science and Sanity (1933).

«<b>General semantics</b> is not any kind of 'philosophy', 'psychology', or 'logic'. It is a new extensional discipline through which we explain and learn how to apply our nervous systems most effectively.» - A. Korzybski 

«In <b>general semantics</b>, we do not 'preach' 'morality' or 'ethics' per se, but teach students awareness of abstraction, awareness of multi-order evaluation mechanisms, relationship orientation, etc., which lead to cortico-thalamic integration, and as a result 'morality', 'ethics', awareness of social responsibility, etc., follow <b>automatically</b>. » - A. Korzybski

Alfred Korzybski was born in the late 19th century into a noble family living in the Russian-occupied part of politically divided Poland. ""I was born silent,"" he wrote - an observer looking around with an interest in what was happening. From an early age, he realized his calling to ""solve problems."" His father, an engineer by profession, fostered in him a respect for math and physics, and their practical applications. (Alfred later studied engineering himself.) He grew up a Polish patriot under the oppression of the Tsarist dictatorship. While serving in Russian army intelligence, <b>he witnessed the horrors of World War I</b> on the eastern front. By then, having moved to North America, he had witnessed the reckless behavior of people <b>(including himself)</b> for half his life. ""<b>I was simply tired of human stupidity. I didn't care about anything else</b>.""

Korzybski spent the rest of his days in a purposeful search and attempt to realize his life's dream - to promote harmony among people by understanding and solving the problems of human stupidity (preventable inadequate evaluation) and its consequences. What is it that human beings possess that makes them make tremendous progress in some areas (math, science, applied technology), but come to such a decline in others? Could we find a way to <b>prevent</b> at least some of the human ills and societal problems that Korzybski has seen? Would we have been able to update our maps (both in the narrow and broad sense of the term), including maps of ourselves, to avoid unnecessary misunderstandings and conflicts between people in society? Experience convinced him that people should develop their thinking abilities (which for Korzybski did not exist separately from their emotional life). He was troubled by the lack of a way to help thinking in a purposeful and systematic way. <b>(""Where are we taught how to think? Nowhere."")</b> His knowledge of <b>science and mathematics</b> also convinced him to <b>try to develop a method of thinking for everyday life based on these disciplines</b>. Korzybski conducted research on the 'strange' hypothesis - unconscious factors of personal and social adaptation (sanity) are realized in the professional behavior - including language - of scientists and mathema",1

Follow anyone across the fediverse and see it all in chronological order. No algorithms, ads, or clickbait in sight.

This is the official Android app for Mastodon. It is blazing fast and stunningly beautiful, designed to be not just powerful but also easy to use. In our app, you can:

EXPLORE

■ Discover new writers, journalists, artists, photographers, scientists and more
■ See what’s happening in the world

READ

■ Keep up with people you care about in a chronological feed with no interruptions
■ Follow hashtags to keep up with specific topics in real time

CREATE

■ Post to your followers or the whole world, with polls, high quality images and videos
■ Participate in interesting conversations with other people

CURATE

■ Create lists of people to never miss a post
■ Filter words or phrases to control what you do and don’t want to see

AND MORE!

■ A beautiful theme that adapts to your personalized color scheme, light or dark
■ Share and scan QR codes to quickly exchange Mastodon profiles with others
■ Login and switch between multiple accounts
■ Get notified when a specific person posts with the bell button
■ No spoilers! You can put your posts behind content warnings

A POWERFUL PUBLISHING PLATFORM

You no longer have to try and appease an opaque algorithm that decides if your friends are going to see what you posted. If they follow you, they’ll see it.

If you publish it to the open web, it’s accessible on the open web. You can safely share links to Mastodon in the knowledge that anyone will be able to read them without logging in.

Between threads, polls, high quality images, videos, audio, and content warnings, Mastodon offers plenty of ways to express yourself in a way that suits you.

A POWERFUL READING PLATFORM

We don’t need to show you ads, so we don’t need to keep you in our app. Mastodon has the richest selection of 3rd party apps and integrations so you can choose the experience that fits you best. 

Thanks to the chronological home feed, it’s easy to tell when you’ve caught up on all updates and can move on to something else.

No need to worry that a misclick will ruin your recommendations forever. We don’t guess what you want to see, we let you control it.

PROTOCOLS, NOT PLATFORMS

Mastodon is not like a traditional social media platform, but is built on a decentralized protocol. You can sign up on our official server, or choose a 3rd party to host your data and moderate your experience.

Thanks to the common protocol, no matter what you choose, you can communicate seamlessly with people on other Mastodon servers. But there’s more: With just one account, you can communicate with people from other fediverse platforms.

Not happy with your choice? You can always switch to a different Mastodon server while taking your followers with you. For advanced users, you can even host your data on your own infrastructure, since Mastodon is open-source.

NON-PROFIT IN NATURE

Mastodon is a registered non-profit in the US and Germany. We are not motivated by extracting monetary value from the platform, but by what’s best for the platform.

* Pre-meditation delay
* Intermediate meditation intervals
* Free and open-source software

<b>Description</b>

<i>Meditation</i> is a truly minimalistic countdown timer for meditation, with a clean user interface and no clutter. The minimalism of the app embodies meditation's actual purpose.

A notable feature of the app is the ability to customize the volume of the notification bells independently of system volume. This allows you to set a predefined volume so that the sounds will reliably play at the same loudness every time. No more mid-meditation worrying that you remembered to turn the volume up!

Another important feature is for the timer to be as reliable as possible, to ensure an accurate meditation time and prompt ending sound notification.
This is achieved by starting a foreground service and disabling battery optimization.

Reliability is of extreme importance to a meditation tool in order to eliminate all possible worries about the timer not behaving correctly. Just press the button and start!

Privacy Friendly Memo Game is a card game. The goal is to find the same cards in one turn. It belongs to the Privacy Friendly Apps group developed by the research group SECUSO at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. More information can be found an secuso.org/pfa

The application provides two predefined card decks, as well as the option to select own images from your device.
In addition to a single player mode, it is also possible to play in a dual player mode.

Privacy Friendly Memo Game has three difficulty level:
1. a game field with 4x4 cards (overall 16 cards)
2. a game field with 6x6 cards (overall 36 cards)
3. a game field with 8x8 cards (overall 64 cards)

What makes Privacy Friendly Memo Game different from other similar apps?

1. No permissions
Privacy Friendly Memo Game does not require any permissions. The selection of images is done by a task to the gallery so the app does not have any access to the device's storage without the user's control and interaction.

For comparison: The Top Ten of similar apps from the Google Play Store requires an average of 3,9 permissions (in September 2016). These are for instance the access to the network.

2. No advertisement
Many other free apps in the Google Play Store dazzle annoying advertising and also shortens battery life.

<li> ✔️ Share directly from the app </li>

<h2><b>Learn more:</b></h2>

Whenever you take a picture, additional metadata is saved in the image file.

Most smartphones do <i>not inform</i> you about this.

<b>Metadata can look like this:</b>

<ul>
<li> 🕑 On which day was the picture taken, and at what time? </li>
<li> 🗺️ And where exactly? </li>
<li> 📷 Which camera or smartphone was used? </li>
<li> 🔧 What camera settings were used? </li>
<li> 📝 Notes of the photographer or the camera? </li>
<li> 📌 More and more often, even exact GPS coordinates are saved in your photo. </li>
</ul>

Metadata is sometimes very useful — for instance when sorting holiday photos.

As soon as you share photos with others via social media, all this info is visible <i>publicly</i>.

Data collectors and stalkers are more easily able to discover your <i>place of residence or workplace<i> from the metadata or draw conclusions about your <i>daily routine</i>.

Tracking services create more comprehensive advertising profiles and sell your data to other organizations.

Use the Metadata Remover to easily view all that data, <i>remove it entirely</i>, and then share the anonymized photo directly!
That way you stay <i>anonymous</i> and <i>safe</i> on the Internet, while your friends can still admire your cute cat.

<i>Happy sharing! 😽</i>

The goal of the game is to find and mark every mine without triggering one of them.

You reveal a field by clicking on it. If that field contains a mine it is triggered and the game is lost. Otherwise the field will show a number. That number will tell you the amount of mines in the surreounding 8 fields. With that information and logical thinking the mines can be located and marked.

The first field you click each game will not ba a mine. Each game will have a new playing field with randomzed poisitioning of mines, so each game will be a new experience. While the mines are mostly positioned randomly the first field clicked each game will not have a mine, and four or more mines in adjacent fields will be avoided, since such clusters increase the chance of situations that must me solved by guessing.

There are three different gamemodes represinting three difficulties. They differ in playing field size and the amount of mines:

- 6x10 Playing Field with 7 Mines
- 10x16 Playing Field with 24 Mines
- 12x19 Playing Field with 46 Mines
In addition there is the option to create your own gamemode where the size of the playing field (amount of rows and columns) and the proportion of mines (easy / medium / hard).

Up to 10 games can be saved and later continued. Your Performance for the three basic gamemodes is collected and analyzed and can be viewed at the statistic page. There you can check the number of games played, the ratio of won games, the average time of winning mgaes, the number of revealed fields and the 10 best times for each gamemode.

The help page contains information about the app and the rules of the game.

How does Privacy Friendly Notes differ from other similar apps?

1. No Permissions
No permissions are requested by the app. The only permissions granted are those, which Android grants per default.

2. No advertisement
Moreover, Privacy Friendly Notes distinguishes from many other applications in the way that it completely relinquishes advertisements. Advertisement might track a user's actions. It could also shorten battery life or use mobile data.

Pomodoro® Technique is extremely simple but efficient time management technique developed by Francesco Cirillo.

The proposal is it's easier to concentrate on work for a relatively short period (i.e., 25 min) keeping in mind you can take a rest or switch to another activity after that.

That's very simple:
<ul>
<li>You split your work for 25 minute intervals, separated by short break periods
<li>In these 25 minute intervals try to focus on your work as much as possible, try to not distract yourself and to avoid other distractions
<li>After a 25 minute interval take a 5 minute break. During this break do any other activities except for the previous work
<li>Return to the work after the break (or not, if you've finished)
<li>Take a long break about 10–30 minutes after every 4 work intervals
</ul>

<a href=""http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/"">Full Pomodoro® Technique description on the author's website</a>

The Minidoro app may help you in Pomodoro® Technique adoption! Minidoro has:
<ul>
<li>Minimalist user interface: only countdown screen with big digits, it's on all the time while timer's on
<li>See only how much time left, no other distractions
<li>It may turn Do-not-Disturb Mode in your device, no other apps will distract you
<li>You may count your distractions, by yourself or by outside
<li>You may set up your preferences: periods duration, long break frequency, notifications
<li>Dark theme (the only)
<li>No ads
<li>Works on any Android device, phone, table or watch, you may utilize even your old smartphone
<li>Proper work on Samsung® phones and tables (<a href=""https://dontkillmyapp.com"">https://DontKillMyApp.com</a> is not applicable)
</ul>

<b>Wear OS notice</b>

It would be a great feature that Minidoro running on Wear OS turns DnD mode on both Wear OS and Android device. It should be generally possible since Wear OS may turn DnD on Android devices. But there's one nuisance. It's not possible to allow any app to operate DnD Mode in Wear OS from Wear OS UI. The only way to allow Minidoro to operate DnD in Wear OS is ADB command (no root should be needed).

Install Minidoro, turn Wear OS in debug mode and connect to computer.

After that for Wear OS 2.2 (based on Android 9) and above run this: ""adb shell cmd notification allow_listener com.github.ympavlov.minidoro/com.github.ympavlov.minidoro.dnd.DndModeServiceV21""

For any other Wear OS version below (based on Android 8.1 and below) use this: ""adb shell settings put secure enabled_notification_listeners com.google.android.wearable.app/com.google.android.clockwork.stream.NotificationCollectorService:com.github.ympavlov.minidoro/com.github.ympavlov.minidoro.dnd.DndModeServiceV21""

This particular memorization scenario is underserved by more traditional flashcard/memorization apps such as Anki.

For example, if one is learning German, one would eventually have to memorize a list of around 50 verbs that are the so called ""dative verbs"".
One could try to make a really big singular flashcard, or attempt something like cloze deletion, but these are very clunky methods.
With Mnemosyne, one can simply enter the list items one at a time and get feedback on which ones were missed.
One could then focus on just those items that are commonly missed or continue trying to get a perfect score on the original list.

For convenience one can import a csv file into the app to create lists, or just create them manually.
The csv must have a header row with the columns ""Title"" and ""Items"".
Separate each item in the items column by the separate delimiter ""#@!"".
Within a csv file, can specify multiple lists, one in each row. One can also export lists to save elsewhere.

There is a feature that allows for placing related lists together in a collapsible group.
One can nest these groups to near arbitrary depth. One creates a group by prefixing the group title to the list title, followed by ""::"".
For example, to create a grouping of German lists, where one wants a list of nouns and a list of verbs, one would name the two lists German::Nouns and German::Verbs.

3. Enable LAN access to the server: Edit the repository file config.txt and change the setting authentication.onlylocalhost = false. Restart the server afterwards.
4. Install the MoasdaWiki App.
5. In the app you can see a hint that it has to be configured first. Press on that hint.
6. Press on ""Host name"" and enter the host name or IP address of the server instance, e.g. 192.168.1.101. Press OK.
7. In the status section below you should see ""Needs authorization at server"". Otherwise check host name and port again.
8. On server side open the Wiki page in a browser, click on ""Help"" and ""Synchronization"".
9. You can see a list of devices and synchronization sessions. Check the device name and click on ""Grant"".
10. Back in the app press the back button on the upper left corner to get back to the main dialog. Now you can see a hint that the app has to be synchronized. Press on that hint.
11. Now you should have all the server content also in the app and you can see the ""Home-App"" wiki page.

Hint: Content cannot be modified within the app as it is no fun to type Wiki syntax on the mobile device, changes have to be done via the MoasdaWiki Server.

Habit apps focus on specific activities and how to establish to do them each day or n times each week. However, there are strenuous days and days were you feel less fit. Often you start highly motivated and end up frustrated.
With moreDays you focus on how you want to be (goals), e.g. fit or slim or smart or ecological or whatever is important for you. Then you define how you want to reach each goal. One day you are full of energy and may go on a long bike tour, the next day you feel exhausted but may go for a walk and focus a bit more on another goal, i.e. you define more than one way to reach each of your goals and hence ensure to be able to do a step towards your goals each day.
In addition you reflect your days, take a picture of the day, add notes including emojis and remember each day, enjoy each day.
Furthermore, you may track your weight, sleep quality or anything else you may measure. Different charts help you to adapt and reflect your goals, activities and scales.

Turn any text into Morse code, or translate Morse code to text and hear the results.

•	Clean, modern app design and interface.
•	Made to be simple to use for everyone.
•	Realtime translation: type in the word or code and have it translated immediately.
•	Decode from Morse to text, or text to Morse.
•	Press the speaker button to hear the code.
•	Copy the text by pressing the ""Copy"" button.
•	Type in dot and dash using our built-in Morse keyboard. 
•	Libre software (https://github.com/Crazy-Marvin/Morse)
+	More features planned.

Don’t let the special characters or dots and dashes befuddle you.

Morse code is a system to encode letters and numbers to dash and dot signs.
The duration of the dash is three times the duration of a dot.
Each dot or dash is followed by period of signal absence, called a space, equal to the dot duration.

Morse code was first used for communicating via telegraph.
The most well-known Morse code is SOS, which is used to signal an emergency.
Aside from typing dots and dashed, you can also signal Morse code by turning light on and off, sounding a horn or tapping, etc.
All means of transmitting Mores code require the recipient understands it.
If not, our cipher tool can be used to find out the password, secret number, or any info you want to relay. 
Since people rarely communicate via telegraph, or learn it in the military, very few people have Morse codes memorized.
Instead, it has become a way to encode something for special purposes.
It’s a useful language to know even if you just want to learn cryptography or solve cryptograms for fun.

1.	Tell others when you are in a dangerous situation (SOS).
2.	Hide your secret number or password via dots and dashes.
3.	Cipher or decipher hidden clues in games.
4.	Learn cryptography or cryptogram through learning Morse codes.
5.	Become a codebreaker by breaking secret codes in real time translation.
6.  Create a secret number.

Only €5/month.

<b>Get started</b>

1. Install the app.
2. Create an account.
3. Add time to your account via our website or vouchers.

To make sure to block third-party cookies and other tracking technologies – use Mullvad VPN together with Mullvad Browser (free of charge).

<b>ANONYMOUS ACCOUNTS – NO ACTIVITY LOGS</b>
&#8226;&#8195;Creating an account requires no personal info - not even an email address.
&#8226;&#8195;We keep no activity logs.
&#8226;&#8195;We offer the possibility to pay anonymously with cash or cryptocurrency.
&#8226;&#8195;Bypass geographical restrictions with our global network of VPN servers.
&#8226;&#8195;Our app uses WireGuard, a superior VPN protocol that connects fast and doesn’t drain your battery.

<b>HOW DOES MULLVAD VPN WORK?</b>
With Mullvad VPN, your traffic travels through an encrypted tunnel to one of our VPN servers and then onward to the website you are visiting. In this way, websites will only see our server’s identity instead of yours. Same goes for your ISP (internet service provider); they’ll see that you’re connected to Mullvad, but not your activity.
It also means that all the third-party actors with technology integrated into the various websites you visit can’t sniff out your IP address and use it to track you from one site to another.

Using a trustworthy VPN is a great first step to reclaim your privacy online. In combination with Mullvad Browser you make sure to block third-party cookies and other tracking technologies.

<b>FREE THE INTERNET FROM MASS SURVEILLANCE AND DATA COLLECTION</b>
A free and open society is a society where people have the right to privacy. That’s why we fight for a free internet.
Free from mass surveillance and censorship. Free from big data markets where your personal information is up for sale. Free from authorities mass monitoring every click you make. Free from an infrastructure mapping your whole life. Mullvad VPN and Mullvad Browser is our contribution to the fight.

<b>TELEMETRY AND CRASH REPORTS</b>
The app collects a very minimal amount of telemetry, and it does not in any way tie it to an account number, IP or other identifiable information. Account numbers are used for authentication. App logs are never sent automatically but are rather explicitly sent by the user. App version checks are performed every 24 hours to tell the app if there are any upgrades available and if the currently running version is still supported.

If the split tunneling feature is used, then the app queries your system for a list of all installed applications. This list is only retrieved in the split tunneling view. The list of installed applications is never sent from the device.

This restriction can lead to issues, such as apps displaying incorrect characters due to Han unification, where characters in one language may appear in another. For example, without Japanese added as a locale, apps may show Chinese characters instead of Japanese ones.

<i>This app reflects my experience with the usagae statistics API from a few Android versions ago. It may no longer be current and this app is no longer being maintained.</i>

The Android system collects app usage statistics in the background; however, native Android contains no way to read out this data properly. That is why I wanted to create a tool to display it. Unfortunately, I had to learn that this data source was riddled with bugs and highly unreliable.

Thus, I converted this application into a museum. It exhibits aggregated usage statistics per day for usually the past ten days, per week for the past four weeks, per month for the past six months as well as data aggregated by year. As a special exhibition, it can display this data as charts.

Design-wise, the app comes in the style of the settings app to highlight that this API is a part of the Android system.

An included Guide to the exhibition names some of the issues you can expect to find on your tour.

<b>My Location</b> finds your device's location in the following ways:

<b>-</b> <b>GPS</b> is usually the most accurate method. But a position fix may take some time or may not work at all due to signal loss. <b>Lock GPS</b> feature runs a persistent service to keep connected with the satellites.

You can also see the list of visible satellites with their PRNs (unique identifiers) and SNR (signal quality).

<b>-</b> <b>Network Location Provider</b> uses Wi-Fi or Cellular ids to estimate the location. On the devices with Google Play Services installed, NLP usually uses Google Location Service at backend.

<b>-</b> <b>UnifiedNLP</b> is an open source API which has been used to develop multiple NLP backends (https://github.com/microg/UnifiedNlp/wiki/Backends).

<b>Furthermore:</b>
<b>-</b> Location coordinates can be copied to clipboard or opened in a maps app, if installed.
<b>-</b> Clearing A-GPS aiding data is also supported.

<b>Note</b> that My Location is not a location provider like UnifiedNLP (or microG GmsCore). It just shows the location information received from AOSP location providers (GPS and Network) or directly from UnifiedNLP Backends (whichever are available on the device).

For cellular records it supports logging GSM, CDMA, UMTS, LTE, and NR records.</p>

<p>You might receive an alert from anti-malware software indicating that Network Survey sends SMS messages in private manner to deceive users. This is NOT the case. SMS permission is necessary for some of the logging that is done. Just to be clear though, Network Survey does not send any text messages, nor does it install anything. In fact, you can deny all the SMS permissions if you are not using the CDR (call detail record) logging feature. The SMS permissions are only requested the first time you turn on CDR logging. More information can be found in this GitHub Discussion: https://github.com/christianrowlands/android-network-survey/discussions/35</p>

<p>This app has the ability to access your device's location in the background. The background location permission is needed to start Network Survey at boot. You can deny this permission if you don't want to start Network Survey at phone boot. More information can be found in the App's privacy policy located at <a href=""https://github.com/christianrowlands/android-network-survey/blob/master/privacy_policy.md"">https://github.com/christianrowlands/android-network-survey/blob/master/privacy_policy.md</a></p>

<p>The cellular logging feature logs several details about the current serving cell, and then some basic information about the neighbor cells. This app won't log all 5 cellular protocols at once. Instead, it will only log information about the protocols that are current connected. If logging for one specific protocol is desired, then the phone must be locked to that protocol (try using *#*#4636#*#* from the dial pad).</p>

<p>The cellular survey records can be streamed to either a gRPC server or a MQTT broker. This is not on by default and a gRPC server or MQTT Broker needs to be setup for this feature to work.</p>

<p>See the <a href=""https://github.com/christianrowlands/network-survey-messaging"">NS Messaging GitHub Repo</a> for more details on setting up a network survey gRPC server.</p>

<p>See <a href=""https://mosquitto.org""> for information on setting up a MQTT Broker.</p>

<p>A bonus feature of this app is its ability to create a Call Detail Record (CDR) file. If enabled, CDR events are logged to a CSV file.</p>

<p>The app also has a calculator that converts an LTE Cell ID to the corresponding eNodeB ID and Sector ID, and a calculator that converts an LTE PCI to the corresponding Primary Sync Sequence (PSS) and Secondary Sync Sequence (SSS).</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy this app as much as I have enjoyed writing it. If you have any feature requests please feel free to reach out by creating a GitHub issue at the link below.</p>

The synchronisation can be done direct (with nextloud) or with the local storage.

Synchronize directly works with Single Sign On (SSO) per nextcloud client.
The local storage can synchronized in other ways, there is no dependency to a client.

<b>First steps</b>
After first installation (or with the current update from 2.x.x to 3.0.0) it shows the login screen.
If the nextcloud client is installed and you want to synchronize direct with the nextcloud server, you can use
the login button to show a list of accounts and you choose the account to login.
Then the app will download the recipes with the REST api.

If you want to synchronize with the local storage, you can skip the login (""Skip for local storage"").
After that, you have to choose the recipe directory in the settings and permit access.
In the app ""All categories"" is the main view, there the app is loading the recipes from the choosen directory.

When using the Nextcloud Android client, you find the directory on your storage under <code>Android/media/com.nextcloud
.client/nextcloud/&lt;your account&gt;/&lt;folder&gt;</code>.

You also can choose the theme in the settings.
After that, the start view has a list of recipes and you select a recipe to view the details.

<b>IMPORTANT</b>: With direct pick of the nextcloud folder there will no images shown and the uri can't be stored right. Perhaps at next app start no recipes can be loaded.
Therefore it is better to use the above mentioned path on the SD card (see First steps).

NFC Quick Settings has no user interface of it's own. Instead, once installed, you will see a new ""NFC"" tile available when customising your Quick Settings menu. See ""Add, remove, or move a setting"" in Android Help for more information on customising the Quick Settings menu: https://support.google.com/android/answer/9083864?hl=en#customize_settings

Once the NFC Quick Settings tile has been added to your Quick Settings menu, the tile will show the current NFC status.

Android security limitations do not allow any third-party apps, such as this, to turn NFC on or off directly, so when tapped, the NFC Quick Settings tile will simply open the device's NFC Settings page (if the device has one), where you can enable or disable NFC as desired.

NFC Quick Settings also has an advanced mode that allows NFC to be toggled directly from the tile, without having to going the NFC Settings page. But this advanced mode requires special permissions, which can only be granted via the Android Debug Bridge on a desktop computer. You can read more about this mode at https://github.com/pcolby/nfc-quick-settings?tab=readme-ov-file#advanced-mode

Originally known as Geschenkt!, it was first published by Amigo Spiele in 2004 and later translated into English by Z-Man Games.

Card Range: The game features playing cards numbered from 3 to 35. Before the game begins, nine cards are randomly selected and removed from the deck, which is then thoroughly shuffled.

Chips Distribution: The number of chips each player receives at the start of the game depends on the player count. With 3 to 5 players, each player begins with 11 chips. For 6 players, each starts with 9 chips, and in games with 7 players, each player receives 7 chips. Players also have the option to conceal their chips from others if they wish.

Game Initiation: The first player initiates the game by revealing the top card from the shuffled deck. They have a choice: they can either take the card, accumulating points according to its value, or opt to pass on it by paying a chip, which is then placed on the card. The player must declare ""No thanks!"" when passing. Subsequently, play continues in a clockwise direction, with each player making the same decision when their turn arrives.

Collecting Cards and Chips: The gameplay continues until a player decides to take the card along with all the chips accumulated on it, if any. The player who accepts the card then flips over the next card and repeats the process, deciding whether to take it or pass it. This pattern persists until all the cards in the deck have been taken.

Scoring: In the final scoring phase of the game, players calculate their points based on the values of the cards they have collected. Notably, cards in a consecutive run are treated as a single card with the lowest value. For example, a run of cards with numbers 30, 29, 28, and 27 would be considered a 27-point set. Each chip held by a player incurs a negative point, resulting in a strategic consideration to minimize the number of chips you accumulate.

Victory: The player or players with the lowest overall point total win the game. Mastering the art of minimizing card values and judicious chip management are key strategies for success in No Thanks!

It also allows a (less-useful) change of mode on Bose QC Earbuds and Bose QC 45 headphones (but not able to fully disable active noise cancellation on these devices).

For example, the Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 can cycle through noise cancellation presets, but these are on a scale from actively passing external sound through, to cancelling out external sound. In a very quiet room, any setting on this scale can result in an audible hiss, and you may not want any active pass-through/cancelling at all, but just the source sound. 

This app allows you to turn off noise cancellation, either in the app, or by adding a quick settings tile, or adding a single touch shortcut you can pin to your launcher.

Noise cancelling will turn back on if you alter the noise control settings on the headphones, or when you next turn the headphones on.

• Only anonymous data is transferred
• There are no audio recording: only acoustic indicators are calculated and transferred
• NoiseCapture App requires only strictly necessary permissions

<i>Warning:</i>
• Although NoiseCapture App is developed by specialists, keep in mind that a smartphone will never replace a professional sound meter. If you need advanced expertise, contact a professional.
• The quality of the measurement depends on the technical performance of your smartphone and its calibration. Depending on the nature of your phone and the version of Android used, it is possible that you can not measure with sufficient accuracy.

NoiseCapture App is the result of collaboration between two French research laboratories, the <a href=""http://www.lae.ifsttar.fr""> Laboratory of Environmental Acoustics </a> (Ifsttar) and DECIDE team of <a href=""http://www.lab-sticc.fr/"">Lab-STICC</a> (CNRS), with a support from the European Commission.

Nonocross is a simple number puzzle game based around grids. The game is known by many names Nonograms, Picross, Griddlers, Pic-a-Pix, Hanjie and various others.

- Modes
There are two game modes. You can either practice on a pre-made grid, or you can play a randomly generated grid with custom parameters.

- How to play
The game is relatively simple, the number in each row/column corresponds to the number of filled cells in that row/column. So '3 5' at the beginning of a column means there is a block of 3 cell and a block of 5 cell in that column which are not touching. Once you have the grid in front of you it will all make sense

- Notes
The camera permission is used to share puzzles using QR codes

Many entities on the internet can spy on your activity and take your data.
Governments, big tech, data brokers, internet service providers and advertisers can all try to monitor your online activity. Recent data leakage scandals made it clear that we can't even trust traditional VPN companies.

Our VPN was born to make your internet activities private and a crucial part of this is not making activity logging and tracking possible.

NymVPN is a new type of VPN designed in a way that makes it impossible for anyone to monitor or log your online activity, even for us. Our VPN operates on a decentralized network, with no trusted parties, centralized components, or single points of failure. All functionalities of NymVPN are performed in a decentralized and distributed way, and there is no possibility of enabling centralized logging.

Our VPN encrypts data and shields metadata from traffic analysis through a decentralized Mixnet. Simply put: there is no way for Nym to log your activity, therefore no one can access it.

But what exactly is a Mixnet? A Mixnet is a network of nodes that:
1. Receive encrypted traffic
2. Mix the traffic
3. Redirect the traffic
This process is done up to 5 times (5-hops) and makes it impossible for anyone to monitor or track your online activity.

This is why you should choose our decentralized, secure, and private VPN

Privacy
Our dVPN was built with privacy in mind. We don't store logs (no-logs policy) nor track your activity. Even if someone wanted to steal your data from us, there would be nothing to steal.

Censorship resistance
Our VPN app makes your online activity completely anonymous. We encrypt your traffic, IP address, location and everything that someone with bad intentions could monitor. You are completely safe also thanks to features like the killswitch.

Speed
The speed of our VPN network grows by the minute thanks to many additional nodes joining the Mixnet network. Moreover, we use modern cryptographic algorithms and innovative protocols such as Sphinx and Loopix to make your connection as fast as possible.

Location of choice
With NymVPN you can choose to connect from hundreds of locations around the world.
Download the app --> Choose the location --> Connect

Crypto payments
You are looking for a VPN that accepts crypto payments? Here we are. We are happy to accept payments with cryptocurrencies.

No-ads
Enjoy your VPN ads-free. Our main goal is to protect your privacy, also because of this you won't see any ads in our VPN app.

Limitless usage
Enjoy the internet as much as you want, NymVPN will never limit your traffic.

Our VPN most beloved features:
- 5-hop Mixnet: your internet traffic will be encrypted and sent to mixnodes that will mix it with other traffic packages 5 times, making it impossible for someone to track your online activity.
- 2-hop dVPN: in this case your traffic is encrypted and sent to 2 mixnodes that will mix it. The reduced number of hops results in higher speed.
- No centralized logs: we don't store any activity logs, this makes it impossible for anyone to have access to your internet activity through us.
- Money-back guarantee: if you are not happy with the product we offer a money-back guarantee policy. If you are not happy with something email us at support@nymvpn.com, we are always looking to improve.
- Split tunneling: you can easily choose which of your apps will access the internet through the VPN and which ones will access the internet directly.
- Hide IP: our dVPN will hide all the information linked to you including your IP address.
- Killswitch: our VPN is built to provide privacy and security, that's why in case your VPN connection drops the killswitch will block your internet access, keeping you and your data safe",1

This should help you to manage what your audience can see / hear without the need to switch to OBS on your machine and make such changes. You can keep doing what you do and easily use this app to control OBS!

Currently OBS Blade supports:

- Start / stop the stream
- Changing the active scene
- Toggle visibility of scene items (like desktop capture etc.)
- Change the volume of your current audio sources (or mute them)
- View any Twitch chat and write messages
- See live statistics of your stream performance (FPS, CPU usage, kbit/s etc.)

OBS Blade also saves statistics of your previous streams so you can track the overall performance and some nice to know facts!

This app is still in its early stages and will get updated with new features over time - for now the main features which I want to add are:

- More engagement with OBS (renaming, sorting, scripted switching etc.)
- Export / merge statistics
- Soundboard
- Incoming feature requests
- (Maybe) Streamlabs client connection

I hope you have a good time using this app. If you encounter any bugs, have feature requests or anything similar, feel free to get in touch with me!

Octal solar time is a location-specific time system that defines a day as the time between two consecutive solar midnights. Known to contain 24 hours in the regular clock system, a day is divided into 8 equally long octal hours. Each octal hour is divided into 64 equally long octal minutes. Each octal minute is divided into 64 equally long octal seconds.

The clock is visualized by an hour finger that runs one cycle per day, with 0 (solar midnight) at the bottom and 4 (solar noon) at the top. In addition, the octal hour and minute is also shown digitally as a three-digit octal number in the center. A golden arch visualizes the time between sunrise and sunset.

Locations can be managed and chosen. Locations can be added by an online search function backed by wikidata.

Privacy notice: When using the location search function, the app connects to a wikidata server and shares your typed search term in order to get search results. This is the only situation when the app uses internet connection.

IP camera's RTSP streams are added via its url and shown in the classic tile configuration. The number of tiles is automatically chosen based on the number of configured cameras: a single camera goes full screen, adding more cameras the app switches to a grid view: 2x2, 3x3, 4x4 and so on.
The maximum number of cameras is determined by the device's capabilities.

The stream decoding and rendering is demanded to VLC's library: without their effort this app wouldn't be possible.
This app was specifically developed for F-Droid, as I couldn't find any open source RTSP viewers in the main repository.

The app can be opened deeplinking to url ojo://view
To open the app with focus on a specific camera, you can use an intent (it.danieleverducci.ojo.OPEN_CAMERA) to specify which camera you want to view.
The extra argument it.danieleverducci.ojo.CAMERA_NAME will open the app with the camera with the name you specified while adding the camera.
The extra argument it.danieleverducci.ojo.CAMERA_NUMBER starting at 1 could be used as well, if you have multiple cameras with the same name.

See below an example how to use the intent. The flag (-f 268468224) could be useful if you want to switch to another camera while the app is running:

    adb -s <YOUR_DEVICE> shell am start -a it.danieleverducci.ojo.OPEN_CAMERA -f 268468224 --es it.danieleverducci.ojo.CAMERA_NAME <YOUR_CAMERA_NAME>

Sounds are so much fun and this is why you need to download OMGSoundboard.
OMGSoundboard allows you to create your own unique soundboards. What's exciting about this app is that it allows you to be only limited by your imagination. You are free to use whatever sounds you want because it is possible to import sounds you love. A backup is also integrated of course so that you can keep your collection forever. The software is simple and straightforward to use. You can also layer the sounds by adding effects and playing several sound effects at once.

OMGSoundboard works offline, offers a good search function, and the ability to set sounds as ringtones and/or alarms.

Please note that OMGSoundboard has just a very limited amount of sounds available by default because of copyright reasons.

The following are some of the app's main features:
✔️	You have the option of making as many soundboards as you want.
✔️	Your personal tunes can be imported
✔️	You have complete control over when the sound starts and stops.
✔️	Sounds can be played back at the same time, allowing you to layer them if desired.
✔️	OMGSoundboard will back up your sounds so they don't get lost.
✔️	All apps that allow sharing can be used to share the sounds. (Bluetooh, Wifi, NFC, Social Networks, and so on.)
✔️	You get to select Ringtone, Alarm, and Notification sounds.
✔️	You can save your favorite sounds as bookmarks.
✔️	Allows for word-filtering for a more useful and fast search inside a large number of sounds.
✔️	No ads and no trackers.

Using standard alarm app I had a lot of alarms which then I had to delete manually to avoid clutter.
Using the standard calendar event notifications were not loud enough so I could forget about them if I didn't have my phone nearby.
This app solves this use case. After alarm is fired it is deleted, it doesn't have to be deleted manually as in normal alarm application.

READ BEFORE USE!
In this app it's only possible to set alarms which don't repeat and only for today or tomorrow!
Don't expect this app to be used as a replacement for your standard alarm app or calendar! 
It's a different type of application! It is not a calendar or standard alarm clock app.

Is your network unusually slow? Run OONI Probe to find out!

With this app, you will examine the blocking of websites and instant messaging apps, measure your network's speed and performance, and check whether systems that could be responsible for censorship and surveillance are in your network.

OONI Probe is developed by the Open Observatory of Network Interference (OONI), a free software project (under The Tor Project) that aims to uncover internet censorship around the world.

Since 2012, OONI’s global community has collected millions of network measurements from more than 200 countries, shedding light on multiple cases of network interference.

Collect evidence of internet censorship
You can check whether and how websites and instant messaging apps are blocked. The network measurement data you will collect may serve as evidence of internet censorship.

Detect systems responsible for censorship and surveillance
OONI Probe tests are also designed to uncover the presence of systems (middleboxes) that could be responsible for censorship and surveillance.

Measure the speed and performance of your network
You can measure the speed and performance of your network by running OONI's implementation of the Network Diagnostic Test (NDT). You can also measure video streaming performance with the Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) test.

Open data
OONI publishes network measurement data because open data allows third parties to verify OONI findings, conduct independent studies, and answer other research questions. Openly publishing OONI data also helps increase transparency of internet censorship around the world. You can explore and download OONI data here: https://ooni.io/data/

Free software
All OONI Probe tests (including our NDT and DASH implementations), are based on free and open source software. You can find OONI software projects on GitHub: https://github.com/ooni. Curious to learn how OONI Probe tests work? Learn more: https://ooni.io/nettest/

Did it ever happen to you? You click a link (let's say a video link) and the system does not ask you anything and opens the link in the browser. And you are stuck in a web page instead of watching the video in the native app.

There are 2 options for you. You either watch the video in the web or you remember the name of the video and search it in the app. Well, not anymore.

With OpenLinkWith, you can share any webpage with it and it will ask you which applications to open the link with.

Although the original intent of the application is to direct web pages to apps, it can even be used to switch between apps. Imagine you have 2 Twitter clients in your phone. You can open a tweet in the official Twitter application and then switch to an another app with the same tweet opened. Cool, hah?

Although the problem discovered above is not huge, it is missing in the Android ecosystem. And I couldn't find anything doing this. So I wrote one. :)

If you find yourself sharing the same url over and over, you can use ""Add to Home Screen"" feature to add your favorite link from your favorite app to your home screen.

I hope you find this useful. Please help me by trying it and sending feedback to me.

<strong>Note:</strong This app also fixes links for some of the most popular Android applications. Not all but most of the links from these websites will be open with respective native android apps when you share them with Open Link With.

The app uses internet to: 
- Send crash reports
- Resolve redirects of shortened links
- Find the title of the link while using ""Add to Home Screen""

Flexible

Apps are grouped to categories (a category can contain one or multiple App).

You can chose per category at which times it should be allowed. This allows preventing playing games too late.

Additionally, you can configure time limit rules. These rules limit the total usage duration at one day or over multiple days (e.g. a weekend). It is possible to combine both, e.g. 2 hours per week end day, but in total only 3 hours.

Moreover, there is the possibility to set an extra time. This allows using something longer than regulary once. This can be used as bonus. There is additionally the option to disable all time limits temporarily (e.g. for the whole day or an hour).

Multi user support

There is the scenario that one device is used by exactly one user. However, with tablets, there are often multiple possible users. Due to that, it is possible to create multiple user profiles in TimeLimit. Each user has got different settings and time counters. There are two kinds of users: parents and children. If a parent was chosen as user, then there are no restrictions. Parents can chose any other user as current user.

Notes

It can be a good idea to take a look at <a href=""https://timelimit.io/en/configsuggestions/"">https://timelimit.io/en/configsuggestions/</a> if you don't use TimeLimit in the default scenario.

TimeLimit does not work good at some smartphone brands (mostly Huawei and Wiko). With the correct settings, it can work better. But better is not good.

If it ""does not work"": This can be caused by power saving features. You can find at https://dontkillmyapp.com/ how you can disable these features. Get in touch with the support if that does not help.

Depending on the Android version, TimeLimit uses the permission for the usage stats access or the GET_TASKS permission. These are only used to detect the currently used App. Based on the currently used App, the App is blocked, allowed, or the remaining time is calculated.

The device admin permission is used to detect an uninstallation of TimeLimit.

TimeLimit uses the notification access to block notifications of blocked apps and to count and block background playback. Notifications and their contents are not saved.

TimeLimit uses an accessibility service to press the home button before showing the lock screen. This fixes blocking in some cases. Moreover, this allows opening the lockscreen at newer Android versions.

TimeLimit uses the permission ""draw over other Apps"" to allow opening the lockscreen at newer android versions and to overlay blocked Apps until the lockscreen is launched.

TimeLimit uses the location access to detect the used WiFi network and allow/ block Apps depending on it and your settings. The location access is not used otherwise.

Compatible with the OpenPGP Standard.,"OpenKeychain helps you communicate more privately and securely. It uses encryption to ensure that your messages can be read only by the people you send them to, others can send you messages that only you can read, and these messages can be digitally signed so the people getting them are sure who sent them. OpenKeychain is based on the well established OpenPGP standard making encryption compatible across your devices and systems. For a list of compatible software for Windows, Mac OS, and other operating systems consult http://openpgp.org/software/.

Modern encryption is based on digital “keys”. OpenKeychain stores and manages your keys, and those of the people you communicate with, on your Android smartphone. It also helps you find others’ keys online, and exchange keys. But its most frequent use is in using those keys to encrypt and decrypt messages.

★ Integration with other Apps:
• K-9 Mail
• Conversations
• and many more…

★ Open Source: OpenKeychain is designed to be trustworthy. It’s Free Software with no secrets; anyone can examine and validate every bit of it (Source code available at https://github.com/open-keychain/open-keychain)

★ Independent Security Audit: The auditing company Cure53 performed an intensive security audit of OpenKeychain. The security experts summarize their final result with ""[...] none of the spotted issues were considered to be of a critical severity in terms of security implications. The latter is a significant and impressive result for an app of this complexity and relevance.""

★ Permissions: Because OpenKeychain is Free Software, anyone can validate that the permissions are indeed only required for the listed features.

Outsmart your competition by beating them to attractive passenger and commodities routes to become the game's highest-ranking transport company by the year 2050.

OpenTTD is based on Chris Sawyer's Transport Tycoon Deluxe and introduces a whole set of new features, including multiplayer support, better stations and vehicles, larger maps and a host of other options. 

Posting a full list of features would be futile as it would mean updating this page almost daily, and even then some things might be forgotten.

* Scroll the map with two fingers, when you are building roads or stations.
* Close dialogs by dragging them to the screen edge.

opsu! runs on Windows, OS X, and Linux.
A this libGDX port also supports Android devices.

'''Beatmaps'''
opsu! requires ""beatmaps"" to run, which contain the songs and gameplay data.
These can be downloaded directly through opsu! in the downloads menu, or
manually from the [https://osu.ppy.sh/p/beatmaplist osu! website] (requires
registration) and mirror sites like [http://bloodcat.com/osu/ Bloodcat].
Place any manually downloaded beatmaps (in .osz format) in the `Import/`
directory for opsu! to unpack them automatically.

If osu! is installed, opsu! will attempt to read beatmaps from the osu!
installation location.  The beatmap directory can also be changed by setting
the ""BeatmapDirectory"" value in the generated configuration file.

'''First Run'''
opsu! will parse all beatmaps when launched, which can take a while for the
first time.  If no beatmaps are found, the game will prompt you to download some
to get started.

Game settings can be changed in the options menu, accessed by clicking the
""Other Options"" button in the song menu.  The ""Music Offset"" value will likely
need to be adjusted initially, or whenever hit objects are out of sync with the
music.

'''Directory Structure'''
The following files and folders will be created in the opsu folder in storage as needed:
* `.opsu.cfg`: The configuration file.  Most (but not all) of the settings can
  be changed through the options menu.
* `.opsu.db`: The beatmap cache database.
* `.opsu_scores.db`: The scores and player database.
* `.opsu.log`: The error log.  All critical errors displayed in-game are also
  logged to this file, and other warnings not shown are logged as well.
* `Songs/`: The beatmap directory (not used if an osu! installation is detected).
  The parser searches all of its subdirectories for .osu files to load.
* `Skins/`: The skins directory.  Each skin must be placed in a folder within
  this directory.  Any game resource (in `res/`) can be skinned by placing a
  file with the same name in a skin folder.  Skins can be selected in the
  options menu.
* `Replays/`: The replay directory.  Replays of each completed game are saved
  as .osr files, and can be viewed at a later time or shared with others.
* `Import/`: The import directory.  All beatmap packs (.osz) and skin
  packs (.osk) are unpacked to the proper location.  All replays (.osr) are
  moved to the replay directory, and their scores saved to the scores database.
* `Screenshots/`: The screenshot directory. Screenshots can be taken by
  pressing the F12 key.
* `Natives/`: The native libraries directory.
* `Temp/`: The temporary files directory.  Deleted when opsu! exits.

Further, no text is truncated, i.e. long movement names or performer lists will take as much space on the screen as they need to be visible in full length.

This application might be seen as an advanced version of the Unpopular Music Player, with added music database query functionality and further enhancements.

The program can work together with the Classical Music Tagger and the Classical Music Scanner.

* Nowhere text is truncated (with ""...""), even the longest work and movement descriptions get the space they need.
* Composer and grouping (work, movements)
* Views: albums, composers, works, genres, performers, folders
* Filter for combinations of composer, genre etc.
* Text search
* Play lists
* ""gapless"" playback (as far as supported by Android)
* If configured, uses database built by Classical Music Scanner, otherwise the system database.
* Call Classical Music Tagger or Classical Music Scanner directly from app
* Meta data transferred via Bluetooth to car radio
* Six colour themes
* Scalable UI, also for tablets
* Portrait and landscape orientation

You can use it to exchange private encrypted and covert chat- or email messages or store your own encrypted notes on your phone.

See our demo videos:
* <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZ9dA5ELXE"">Introduction</a>
* <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZ_-5X2tiAo"">Encrypting Emails</a>
* <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=laq7SGwiuAw"">Encrypting Images</a>

Oversec is completely agnostic of the subjacent app, it works with Whatsapp™, Line™, Snapchat™, Instagram™ or any other chat app. It also supports sending and receiving PGP encrypted messages with the Gmail™  or any other Email app.

End-to-End Encryption was yesterday. Oversec introduces ""Eye-to-Eye"" encryption. <b>Encrypted data is only decrypted while it is shown on the screen!</b> No clear text is ever persisted and thus cannot be extracted from the file system or accidentally be backed up into the cloud.

We also carefully designed Oversec so that it doesn't require internet access. Because of that, you can rest assured that no decrypted information can ever leave your device.

<u>How it works:</u>

Oversec constantly monitors the text on your screen. When it finds an encrypted text, it tries to decrypt it and then shows the decrypted text as an overlay in place of the encrypted text. Conversely, it can read text out of an input field, encrypt it, and then put the encrypted text back into the input field.

In order to encrypt a text, Oversec shows a button next to an active input field. After having entered the secret text, tapping that button makes Oversec read the text, encrypt it and put back the encrypted text into the field. It is now ready to be sent in the subjacent app as usual - the app doesn't even know that it is sending encrypted data!

Oversec also features a unique way of encoding the encrypted messages. It stores the encrypted text in invisible (zero-width) characters and let's you add decoy text at the end. That way, a message will just show e.g. ""The sun is shining!"" with no visible sign of any encryption, whereas in reality it contains a hidden encrypted message.

You may also encrypt and send photos through Oversec - its unique camera mode even allows you to take and send an encrypted photo without ever storing the original photo on the device.

Oversec encrypts your data either using symmetric keys (using ChaCha20 cipher + Poly1305 MAC ) or using asymmetric PGP encryption (making use of the <a href=""https://f-droid.org/packages/org.sufficientlysecure.keychain/"">OpenKeychain</a> app).

The code is open source and can be found <a href=""https://github.com/oversecio/oversec"">here</a>.

It allows you to make daily diary entries recording your condition and the intensity, location, nature and time of the pain you feel, as well as the medication you take and additional notes. Records of your pain can help health professionals gain an insight into the pain you are experiencing.

The main view of the app is a calendar. A new diary entry can be added and existing diary entries can be viewed by selecting a day in this calendar. Diary entries can be exported to PDF. You have to specify a period of time for which the entries are to be exported. You also have the option to share that PDF.

Privacy Friendly Pain Diary has a daily reminder function. If enabled, it displays a notification reminding you to make a diary entry if you have not made one yet. You can set the time at which you want to be reminded in the settings.

How does Privacy Friendly Pain Diary differ from other similar apps?
1) Minimal permissions
Privacy Friendly Pain Diary requires write access to your device’s storage if you wish to
export your diary entries to PDF. All other features do not require any permissions.

2) Protection of privacy
User data is not recorded, nor sent to any third party. The data you enter is only locally
stored on your device.

3) No advertisements or tracking mechanisms
Privacy Friendly Pain Diary distinguishes itself from many other applications in the way that it does not include any advertisements or tracking mechanisms. Advertisements can shorten battery life or consume mobile data, while tracking mechanisms can compromise privacy.

Privacy Friendly Pain Diary belongs to the group of Privacy Friendly Apps developed by the SECUSO research group at Karlsruhe Institue of Technology. Privacy Friendly Apps are Android applications which are optimized regarding privacy. Further information can be found here: https://secuso.org/pfa.

Parts are usually specified in the form of fractions as divident / divisor.
With different parts using different divisors it is difficult to compare the sizes of the parts.
The main gist of Parti is to determine the least common multiple (lcm) of all different divisors.
(The different parts can be expressed using the lcm as common divisor making the parts easily comparable.)
</p>

<p>
Divisors are represented and processed as BigInts in order to provide exact results.
(BigInts are designed to store whole values of arbitrary size, as long as enough memory is available.)
</p>

<p>General Usage:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    After entering a divisor in the central editor widget
    it can be added / removed with the button to the right of the input field.
    The list of divisors in the bottom section is changed accordingly.
    Also, lcm and gcd in the top section are updated to reflect the new list of divisors.
  </li>
  <li>
    Tapping a value in the list puts the value into the editing widget.
    Dragging a list value to the left removes it from the list and puts it into the editor widget.
    Dragging a list value to the right removes it without changing the editor widget.
  </li>
  <li>
    In the top bar, a button for clearing the whole list is available.
    There are also buttons for undoing and redoing any changes of the current session.
  </li>
  <li>
    The value of the gcd can be changed deliberately
    with any change modifying the list of divisors accordingly:
    Tapping the value of the gcd opens a requester to replace the gcd with an arbitrary whole number.
    There is a button to set it to 1 (or to the value it had before it was set to 1).
    Further buttons increase or decrease the gcd by 1.

passwords for all your accounts while remembering only one master
password. Detailed information about generating passwords can be found at the app's help page or at https://secuso.org/pfa. The app belongs to the Privacy Friendly Apps group developed by the research group SECUSO. More information can be found an https://secuso.org/pfa

In case you wish to generate a password for a user account, you can add this account to Privacy Friendly Password Generator. Therefore, you only have to enter which characters (lower-case letters, upper-case letters, numbers, special characters) you would like the password to consist of and how long it should be.
The account are arranged in a list. To generate a password, click on the account and enter your master password. The master password is a password made up by you and it guides all other passwords. Like the other passwords it is not stored in the application. So if you wish you can write it down and keep it in a safe place.
Finally, Privacy Friendly Password Generator displays the password which has been generated for you account. This password can be re-generated any time.

In case you wish to find out how Privacy Friendly Password Generator generates the passwords, have a look at https://secuso.org/pfa

How does Privacy Friendly Password Generator differ from other similar apps?

1. No permissions
Privacy Friendly Password Generator does not require any permissions.
For comparison: The Top Ten of similar apps from the Google Play Store requires an average of 3,4 permissions (in November 2016). These are for instance the location permission or the permissions to access, modify or delete storage.

2. Protection of passwords
Privacy Friendly Password Generator does not store any generated password, nor does it store the master password. For the generation of password a stateless algorithm is used. This means that the passwords only exist during the generation and are not stored in the program after the application has been closed. Additionally, the app prevents devices from taking screenshots.

3. No advertisement
Moreover, Privacy Friendly Password Generator distinguishes from many other applications in the way that it completely relinquishes advertisements. Advertisement might track a user's actions. It could also shorten battery life or use mobile data.

The app requires minimal permissions (Run at startup and prevent phone from sleeping). It belongs to the Privacy Friendly Apps group developed by the research group SECUSO at Karlsruhe Intitute of Technology. More information can be found an secuso.org/pfa

Privacy Friendly Pedometer can count your daily walked steps while it runs in background. It gives you an overview about your walked steps, distance and about the calories you have burned while walking. You can add and choose different walking modes with different step lengths, such as walking or running, to improve the calculation of distance and calories.

In a special training mode you can track your training sessions. To each training session additional information, such as feeling or a description, can be added.

What makes Privacy Friendly Pedometer different from other pedometers?

1. Minimal amount of permissions:
* Run at startup: This permission is required to restart the step counting when your phone boots.
* prevent phone from sleeping: On some devices the processor falls asleep and prevents counting steps. With this permission the app can keep the processor awake while counting steps.

Most of Pedometer Apps in the Google Play Store require additional permissions. E.g. accessing the network or Internet which is mostly used to display advertisement. Some apps have access to GPS or telephony data.

2. No advertisement.
Many other free apps in the Google Play Store dazzle annoying advertising and also shortens battery life.

Take the test to find out how stressed you are.,"The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) is the most widely used psychological instrument for measuring the perception of stress. It is a measure of the degree to which situations in one's life are appraised as stressful. Items were designed to tap how unpredictable, uncontrollable, and overloaded respondents find their lives. The scale also includes a number of direct queries about current levels of experienced stress. The PSS was designed for use in community samples with at least a junior high school education. The items are easy to understand, and the response alternatives are simple to grasp. Moreover, the questions are of a general nature and hence are relatively free of content specific to any subpopulation group. The questions in the PSS ask about feelings and thoughts during the last month.

Evidence for Validity: Higher PSS scores were associated with (for example):
- failure to quit smoking
- failure among diabetics to control blood sugar levels
- greater vulnerability to stressful life-event-elicited depressive symptoms
- more colds

Because levels of appraised stress should be influenced by daily hassles, major events, and changes in coping resources, predictive validity of the PSS is expected to fall off rapidly after four to eight weeks.",1

<ul><li>View, grant or revoke manifest permissions</li><li>View AppOps permissions and choose one of multiple modes</li><li>Set your desired reference value for every changeable permission</li></ul>
<p><b>Manifest permissions</b> are those normally called permissions e.g. Storage, Camera etc. <b>AppOps</b> (app operations) is a robust framework Android uses at back end for access control. With every Android release manifest permissions are becoming more dependent on AppOps. So it's fun to control both simultaneously and see how they relate to each other.</p>
<p>In short, AppOps provide a fine-grained control over many of the manifest permissions. Plus it provides additional controls like background execution, vibration, clipboard access etc. Just install the app to explore it yourself.</p>
<p>When you reinstall an app, or change your device, or upgrade your ROM, it's a time-taking process to review all installed apps for granted permissions and revoke the unnecessary ones (after all  <b><i>privacy matters</i></b>). PMX provides you the solution. Set <b>reference states</b> of permissions, which can be quickly backed up and restored, and colored bars at left make it quite easy to review packages and permissions at a glance.</p>

(by the RWTH Aachen University),"Did you know that you are carrying a 3D magnetometer? That you can use your phone as a pendulum to measure earth\'s local gravitational acceleration? That you can turn your phone into a sonar?

phyphox gives you access to the sensors of your phone either directly or through ready-to-play experiments which analyze your data and let you export raw data along with the results for further analysis. You can even define your own experiments on phyphox.org and share them with colleagues, students and friends.

Selected Features:
- A selection of pre-defined experiments. Just press play to start.
- Export your data to a range of widely used formats
- Remote-control your experiment through a web interface from any PC on the same network as your phone. No need to install anything on those PCs - all you need is a modern web browser.
- Define your own experiments by selecting sensor inputs, defining analysis steps and creating views as an interface using our web-editor (http://phyphox.org/editor). The analysis can consists of just adding two values or using advanced methods like Fourier transforms and crosscorrelation. We offer a whole toolbox of analysis functions.

Sensors supported:
- Accelerometer
- Magnetometer
- Gyroscope
- Light intensity
- Pressure
- Microphone
- Proximity
- GPS
*some sensors are not present on every phone.

Export formats
- CSV (Comma separated values)
- CSV (Tab-separated values)
- Excel
(if you need other formats, please let us know)


This app has been developed at the 2nd Institute of Physics A at the RWTH Aachen University.

This app will show a small piano a baby can use to explore sounds in a
mobile device. At the same time, it will block any naive attempts at
closing the app. The back, home and apps-menu buttons will be blocked,
and Android's top menu won't be available.

This ensures a baby can't accidentally close the game, preventing any
actions on the device you may not want.

Grown ups can unlock the app by touching the settings icon with one

Some apps use hidden processes to record tracking audio in the background that is either generated by nearby beacons, television commercials, streamed music services or websites. This tracking audio is transmitted between 18 kHz and 22 kHz (near ultra high frequency) which is beyond the range of typical human hearing but within the recording range of a typical Android phone.

To block unwanted use of the microphone by hidden app processes, PilferShush Jammer requests use of the hardware microphone from the Android system and holds it. This technique locks up the microphone from any other apps attempting to gain access to it. This technique has been tested only on user apps, not system apps. The Android system should halt PilferShush Jammer from blocking the microphone whenever a phone call is received or made.

When the jamming technique is running and the microphone is locked up, PilferShush Jammer posts a notification to keep the user informed that it is running. Tests have shown that it uses 0% CPU, 0% network and 43.6mb RAM when running for over an hour.

This is an experimental app made as part of research into audio counter-surveillance methods within the Android and IoT world.

It requires RECORD_AUDIO permission so that it may access and lock up the microphone.

* It does NOT record or listen to any audio.
* It does NOT connect to the internet.

'''Version 2.0 Active Jammer addition:'''

Tones can be emitted with a carrier frequency and a drift limit with rate all constrained to NUHF of 18 kHz to 24 kHz depending on the device capabilities. For instance 20000 Hz carrier, drift limit 1000 Hz and rate slow - will output random frequency between 19 kHz and 21 kHz approximately every second.

'''Version 3.0 Jammers run as a service:'''

Both the active and passive jammers now run as a (foreground) service that should accurately indicate whether they are running or not. This is dependent on both the Android OS (power management) and any App Managers that may destroy running services.

As this app seeks to block microphone use it is important to NOT dismiss or hide the notification otherwise you may forget it is running.

Also includes a scanner to check user installed apps for NUHF and Audio Content Recognition (ACR) SDKs as well as any services or receivers.

'''Version 4.0 Redesign'''
Major overhaul of the design to make information clearer and to simplify typical uses of the app

Notes:
Continuing to look into better Active jammer audio output code.

White noise output may not be very effective at blocking and is a somewhat annoying sound.

The speaker output may not have enough amplitude to block unwanted NUHF signals - testing will determine.

Over time I've used several apps to store my PINs, unfortunately none of them really convinced me.

The app obfuscates the PIN in a table layout surrounded by secure random numbers.  
This brings two security benefits:
1. ❔ The app can not know where in the pattern the user given PIN is located at. Attackers can not extract the plaintext PIN.
2. 🕵️ This offers protection against <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder_surfing_(computer_security)"" title=""shoulder surfing"">Shoulder Surfing</a>, for example while accessing your PIN in a super market or a bank.

★ FOR YOUR EYES ONLY: Put a password on the secret message to make sure that no one can read it except the person it’s meant for.
★ EASY IMAGE CHOOSER:  You can use the camera to take photos, or just use photos you’ve already taken.
★ INVISIBLE CHANGES: Even a trained analyst analyst shouldn’t be able to detect any message. The image bytes should seem undistorted.
★ SHARE ACROSS PLATFORMS: Want to share the images over email, file sharing tools (like Dropbox & Sparkleshare), social media (like Google+ & Flickr) or directly through Bluetooth or NFC? Not a problem! The messages are still recoverable on the other side. We'll have even more tools (like Facebook) working soon, so stay tuned!
★ AD-FREE: We want your love, not your money.
★ MATHEMATICALLY SECURE: We use the F5 steganography algorithm which implements matrix encoding to improve the efficiency of embedding and employs permutative straddling to uniformly spread out the changes over the whole steganogram.
★ ATTACK RESISTANT: We’ve launched attacks on images with messages hidden in them using a specialized version of stegdetect, an automated tool for detecting steganographic content in images. In most cases, the pictures have been impervious to attack. We will be including detection in an upcoming version of the application so you can easily test it yourself!

Although there are many other apps and websites that show our solar system much more acurate, Planetario has a combination of features you which make it unique:

* Speed up time to see and understand the path of the planets through the sky
* Zoom in on planets using a virtual telescope
* See the horizon from all places on earth: checkout the different path of the Sun seen from the Northern and Southern hemisphere
* Travel the Moon or another planet to see the horizon from there. Visit the Apollo 16 and Mars Opportunity landing sites. 
* See the earth from the Moon as seen by the astronauts John Young and Charles Duke
* Check whether the Earth and the Moon can be seen from Mars as separate 'stars'
* Visit some far away virtual spacestations to look down on our solar system or see it from the side.

Planetario may help you to:
* Learn where you can spot the planets in the night-sky
* Understand why the planets wander along these strange paths
* Get a grasp for the vast emptyness between our planets, and their tiny size compared to the size of our solar system

We're not portfolio tracker, we won't show you daily ups and downs. We help you keep track of money moving out of your account into different types of investment.

<ul>
<li><p>This app is not a budget management tool, we're not here to manage your day to day spending. This application is here to track all the investment you make. So for example you have invested money in stocks, etfs, bonds, retirement fund, high yield savings account, Fixed deposits, gold bar in your locker or just some money in your savings account. This app will allow you to list all this investments and categorize it for you into different categories/sector of investment. </p>
</li>
<li><p>This application will allow you to record what type of application/service you used to invest your money (For example you use couple of brokers to manage your stock portfolio, this application will allow you to list through which website/app had you invested your money. So when you open this app, it should be easier for you to notice which app to check for particular investment)  And best part is it will calculate the amount invested in each category and show you a graph showing percentage of investment done in all various categories. So consider this application as your one step way to see all the money that you invest in all the places.</p>
<p>   Ofcourse you can do all this using Microsoft Excel as well. But we're not competing with Excel. We're here to give you an alternative way to check your finances. If you prefer to use excel, use that. But make sure your excel file is password protected and with you at all times. Because this application has fingerprint authentication and is installed on your phone on all times. So you just need to take out your phone and will be able to check your investments. (I personally don't like using excel sheet and haven't seen any of my friends commit themselve to use excel sheet to manage their finances for long time. That's the reason I decided to create this application, and as there is an alternative with excel I decided to make it opensource and free. So if you don't like excel to manage your finances, you can jump on to this application.) </p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I've also created a widget for this application. So you can just glimpse over your total invested amount on the homescreen itself. Yeah it's not safe to show this amount on the homescreen but I developed this feature just in case, any of us need any push to continue their job/business. Seeing that total invested amount on the home screen can motivate you to just give that little extra. If you don't feel it's safe to show the amount there, don't use the widget. But I gave that option just in case anyone wants to use it. And you can even place this widget on the different homescreen. So unless you swipe to it, no body else will even know it's there.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Once you've added your investment data, you can share the data you inserted using Export data option in settings tab. You'll be able to share your data as an excel file.</li>
</ul>

<b>Just to be clear, this application is not a portfolio tracker. There are plenty of applications that do that already. We're here to track money going out of your bank account into different type of investment. Consider it an easy way to check how much money you've invested over the years and where.</b>

<i>Plutus</i> doesn't use internet connection, so you can be sure that data you insert in this application is not shared with anyone (unless you share it from the settings menu).

Do I hear your heartbeats?  Great!

Common functionalities of a podcast player are well-supported:
<ul>
<li>Search, discover and subscribe to podcasts, by keywords, simple RSS URLs, or OPML files.</li>
<li>Download, stream or queue episodes, and enjoy them the way you like with adjustable playback speeds.</li>
<li>Save effort, battery power and mobile data usage with powerful automation controls for downloading episodes.</li>
<li>If the feed contains no media (plain RSS feed), Text-to-Speech engine is used to play the text.</li>
<li>Listening progress can be instantly synced through a NextCloud server or across devices in the same Wi-Fi network without a server.</li>
</ul>

So what's special with this podcast app among the many?

Well, aside from doing the above well, the following make it stand out:
<ol>
<li>It's open sourced, free to use and free of ads, free as in beer and free as in speech!</li>
<li>It takes advantage of modern frameworks to be efficient and conserve energy.</li>
<li>In addition to subscriptions, it allows you to create your own synthetic podcasts to compile your interested episodes from various podcasts to better focus on your interests.</li>
<li>While the list of episodes (filtered and sorted by you) in each podcast serves a natural playlist for you, it also empowers you with multiple queues each associable with any podcasts to group similar contents for better listening.</li>
<li>On any podcast/episode, you can assign 5 levels of rating allowing you to make better decisions on where to put your attention.</li>
<li>You have 12 levels of play states (like to play soon, add in queue, or play again) to better plan and record your listening experiences.</li>
<li>You can also keep your personal notes with your opinions/comments on each podcast/episode.</li>
<li>It has sophisticated sorting and filtering options for you to better select contents.</li>
<li>Sure, you can play any episodes in your car's speakers.</li>
<li>And, it's not all about audio, video is well handled.</li>
<li>You can cast the audio/video to Chromecast speakers/screens.</li>
</ol>

Some other podcast players can also do all of the above?

holomorphic function? 

No? Wondering what a 'holomorphic function' is in the first place? 

Don't worry! You don't need to know any of this to use the app. 
Just touch the screen and see the math at work! 

The Poleidoscope shows a rectangular domain of the plane of complex numbers. 
The user sets up roots and poles of a rational function on the screen 
and this function is then used to deflect the live camera picture. 

Holomorphic functions are examples of so-called 'conformal mappings' which 
are prominently featured in the works of contemporary artists such 
as M.C. Escher. The Poleidoscope provides a live experience of similar 
pictures. 

For those more involved in mathematics the app is a way to visualize 
complex polynomials and rational functions and give a feeling for 
several topics in complex analysis such as differentials of holomorphic 
functions, Rouche's theorem, ramifications, local normal forms, etc.

If something really peaks your interest, open the level in the sandbox to see how it ticks. What will you create in the sandbox?

Principia started out as a paid proprietary game developed during 2013-2014 before being abandoned due to financial issues. Now the game is an open source project since 2022 developed by the same community who fell in love with it back in the day, free for anyone to play well into the future.

In addition to being available on Android, Principia is also available on Linux, Windows as well as experimental ports to other platforms.

(By default Principia makes connections to the main community site at principia-web.se. You can change or disable this by creating a file called community_host.txt in the app's scoped storage containing a domain name. If you have the main community site disabled you can still play levels by going via your web browser.)

Privacy Browser has two primary goals.

1. Minimize the data that is sent to the internet.

2. Minimize the data that is stored on the device.

Most browsers silently give websites massive amounts of information that allows them to track you and compromise your privacy. Websites and ad networks use technologies like JavaScript, cookies, DOM storage, user agents, and many other things to uniquely identify each user and track them between visits and across the web.

In contrast, privacy sensitive features are disabled by default in Privacy Browser. If one of these technologies is required for a website to function correctly, the user may choose to turn it on for just that visit. Or, they can use domain settings to automatically turn on certain features when entering a specific website and turn them off again when leaving.

Privacy Browser currently uses Android’s built-in WebView to render web pages. As such, it works best when the latest version of WebView is installed (see https://www.stoutner.com/privacy-browser/common-settings/webview/). In the 4.x series, Privacy Browser will switch to a forked version of Android’s WebView called Privacy WebView that will allow for advanced privacy features.

At the time of this writing, many cell phone networks are switching from 4G (4th Generation) to 5G networks. The 5G network protocols were specifically designed to protect against some of the known insecurities of the older protocols, including those that allowed stingrays (IMSI catchers) to perform man-in-the-middle attacks on cell phone networks. To ease deployment and backwards compatibility, 4G and 5G networks can run together in what is known as 5G NR (New Radio) NSA (Non-Standalone) mode. This uses the 4G network for the control channel and the 5G network for the data communication. However, 5G NR NSA does not provide protection against stingrays. Android has access to all the information it needs to know if it is connected to a 5G NR NSA or a 5G NR SA (Standalone) network, but it doesn’t display that information to the user. The purpose of Privacy Cell is to make that information easy to access.

Privacy Cell can also warn you when you are connected to antiquated 2G and 3G networks.",1

All possible with one plaintext file per day. PTO brings a convenient editor and important additional functions.

• Quickly take notes on the lockscreen, without unlocking your device.
• Reminders for upcoming events (format: <tt>@12:34 -15m foobar</tt>)
• Fast search through all pages.

<b>Origin</b>

This is a (now distant) fork of billthefarmer's Diary: https://github.com/billthefarmer/diary

PTO has a lot of internal and UI changes. It focuses on usage as a general organizer instead of a Diary, though it can still be used as such, if you don't need the removed features. Most notably the markdown view has been removed, so no inline media can be displayed.

In some areas they have even replaced the traditional barcode. A QR Code is able to store up to seven thousand characters and therefore is qualified for more complex content, e.g. vCards. Hence nowadays QR Codes can nowadays be found on nearly every advertisement poster and animate the user to scan it with his smartphone. Thus, it is no longer necessary take a hand written note, it is enough to scan the QR Code. Correspondingly, there are already many QR Code scanner apps available in the Google Play Store. It belongs to the Privacy Friendly Apps group developed by the research group SECUSO at Technische Universität Darmstadt. More information can be found an secuso.org/pfa

Our Privacy Friendly QR Scanner App differs with respect to two aspects:

1. The Privacy Friendly QR Scanner App only requires the minimum amount of permissions, namely:
Most of the QR Code scanner apps available in the Google Play Store need several permissions on top of the ones needed: e.g. reading contacts or your call log and retrieving data from the Internet. Most of these requirements are not necessary for the functionality they actually are supposed to provide.

2. The Privacy Friendly QR Scanner App supports its users in detecting malicious links: QR Codes provide new possibilities for an attacker, as QR Codes can contain malicious links, i.e. links to phishing webpages or webpages from which malware would automatically be downloaded. Therefore it is important to carefully check the link before accessing the corresponding webpage. Since it is difficult for the user to spot malicious links, the Privacy friendly QR Scanner App supports the user by highlighting the domain (e.g. in that case for https://www.secuso.org, secuso.org would be highlighted). To avoid not checking the link and in particular the highlighted domain carefully, the app provides information about possible fraud and its users need to confirm that they checked the link and it is trustworthy. Note, the information shown after scanning an URL based QR Code is not customized for every URL. Hence, it should be considered as an advice for the user how to behave in general.

The Privacy Friendly QR Scanner App supports most of the usual qr code types. Bar codes and other widely used codes are also supported.

The app belongs to the group of privacy friendly apps, that are developed by the SECUSO research group. More information can be found at https://secuso.org/pfa

Aside from the contact sync the user interface is deliberately as close to Conversations as possible. This allows users to eventually migrate from Quicksy to Conversations without having to relearn how the app works.

Suggested contacts consists of other Quicksy users and regular Jabber/XMPP users who have entered their Jabber ID into the Quicksy Directory (https://quicksy.im/#get-listed).

NOTE: To enter (https://quicksy.im/enter/) your Jabber ID in the Quicksy

This is an app created as a demo of some Android features.
The main purpose of the app is to provide a random choice in different ways. The app contains some basic personalization options and an introduction, plus some new resources like animated vector drawables and the full light theme. The design is a bit personal: it follows the Android guidelines, but just partially.
  

<h2><b>Why should i use Randomix? 😕</b></h2>
Well, i'll tell you 3 main reasons:
<ul>
    <li> It can help you to decide randomly in 4 different ways, elegantly! </li>
    <li> It will cost just 3MB of storage! </li>
    <li> It's beautiful, full of animations and simple to use! </li>
</ul>
An example?
&rarr; During a table game, you have to throw a dice, a coin, or choose which player should start: Randomix does it all! 
&rarr; You're hungry but you and your friends can't decide a place to have a meal: just spin the roulette and accept its wise answer!
&rarr; You're starting to develop apps and you need a simple app to look at, to find some inspiration and tricks: click on the Github link, and the Randomix source code is served!
  

<h2><b>Features 🎲</b></h2>
<ul>
    <li> Every tab in the bottom navigation bar contains a type of random choice. The available types are: </li>
    <ul>
        <li> Roulette &rarr; select an option from a list. </li>
        <li> Coin &rarr; simply flips a coin and prints the result. </li>
        <li> Dice &rarr; throws a dice and prints the result. </li>
        <li> Magic Ball &rarr; provides randomly chosen answers to any question. </li>
    </ul>
    <li> The recent options used in the roulette are automatically saved and can be restored! </li>
    <li> Roulette presets, such as 1-100 numbers and letters </li>
    <li> Shake to launch option </li>
    <li> Light and dark themes, Material You </li>
    <li> Up to 10 dice, plus a 3v3 mode </li>
    <li> Selectable accent </li>
    <li> Android 13 per-app language and themed icon support </li>
    <li> Vibration and sounds </li>
    <li> Rude answers, allow equal options, dice number </li>
    <li> First time introduction </li>
    <li> Multiwindows support </li>
    <li> Simple and precise ui following the material guidelines </li>
</ul>

But how do you rank these?

You might be tempted to order them by preference, but this could quickly get overwhelming for long lists.

A much easier method is to use <a href=""https://www.opinionx.co/blog/pairwise-comparison"">pairwise comparisons</a>, which shows you single head-to-head pairs, and has you choose which one you like best.

After doing a small number of these matchups, Rank-My-Favs can confidently create a ranked list for you.

Under the hood, Rank-My-Favs can sort by either the win-rate, or the more advanced Glicko rating system.

Privacy Friendly Reckoning Skills helps you improving your mental calculation skills in the four basic calculating operations.

For each game, the player can choose between the four basic arithmetic operations and four difficulties (exercises up to 10, 100, 1000 and 10000).

After finishing an exercise round the player receives a score which depends on the number of exercises answered correctly and the time it took to answer all ten exercises.

After every game there is an overview which shows whether the exercises were solved correctly. It is also possible to choose ""Direct Feedback"" in the settings. If direct feedback is chosen, the player will receive feedback whether the exercise was solved correctly after each single exercise.

How does Privacy Friendly Reckoning Skills differ from other similar apps?

1) No permissions
Privacy Friendly Reckoning Skills does not require any permissions.

For comparison: The Top Ten of similar apps from the Google Play Store requires an average of 3,4 permissions (in November 2017). These are for instance the location permission or the permissions to access, modify or delete storage.

2) No advertisement
Moreover, Privacy Friendly Ludo distinguishes from many other applications in the way that it completely relinquishes advertisements. Advertisement might track a user's actions. It could also shorten battery life or use mobile data.

This App requires minimal permissions and is part of the Privacy Friendly Apps group
developed by the research group SECUSO at Technische Universität Darmstadt. More information can be found at https://secuso.org/pfa

to the Recoll software.  It uses Recoll's python API and supports multiple users securely

The server layer makes use of FastAPI to provide the restful endpoints for the UI.  It
contains no authentication code itself but depends on a proxying layer to ensure only
validated users can connect.  The supported setup is to use the Nginx reverse proxy to
perform basic auth together with the unit app server to host the recoll rest api.

VPN: Connects to multiple WireGuard VPNs of your choice.

Safe: Reveals network activity of installed apps and lets you disable, uninstall, or firewall them.

Secure: First line of defense against spyware, ransomware, and malware that steal personal information and takeover accounts. Protects from DNS manipulation typically employed to censor websites, social media, and messaging apps.

Fast: DNS Servers deployed to 300+ locations world-wide to ensure your internet is as fast and highly available as it can be.

Open: Open source and free of any trackers.

***Features***

Firewall: Prevent apps from connecting to the Internet. Block spyware, malware, ransomware and more.
     
A firewall blocks any app connecting to the Internet over WiFi or Mobile data. Since most forms of surveillance require the data to be sent the network to a server, firewalling them effectively mitigates the threat (File Managers, Alarm Clock, Calculator are few such examples of apps that do not require any Internet access to function). The firewall feature uses Accessibility Service to detect and firewall background applications.

Monitoring: Keep tabs on incoming and outgoing Internet traffic. 

If enabled, the connectivity logs are collected and analyzed. Automated reports flag previously unknown or suspicious connections, and reveal the extent of attempt to steal data by spyware networks. In our tests, around 60% of the traffic is flagged and reported as being initiated by known spyware. Logs generated are made available in near-real time to the user for their own analysis.

WireGuard: Secure outgoing Internet traffic.

The app uses fast, modern, light-weight, and secure WireGuard protocol to encrypt outgoing connections to any compatible VPN provider of your choice.

Anti-censorship: 

The app encrypts your internet connection to Domain Name System (DNS) server run by Rethink with presence in our 300+ locations world-wide. DNS servers are the address book of the internet: A DNS server provides the exact addresses you need to visit a website or open an app.

Data Monitor: Track per-app and per-connection Mobile or WiFi data usage.

Such apps can do things like lock, disguise themselves, delete private data, send an emergency message, and more.  It is meant for situations where there is time to react, but where users need to be sure it is not mistakenly set off.

This is a BETA version of this app!  We are working now to add support to as many other apps as possible.  ChatSecure, Orweb, Umbrella, and Zom already have support, these apps are coming soon: Courier, PanicButton, OpenKeychain, Orfox, SMSSecure, StoryMaker.

Here are two example scenarios:

* An organization gets regularly raided by the security forces, who search all of the computers and mobile devices on the premises. The organization usually has at least a minute or two of warning before a raid starts. They need a very reliable way to trigger wiping all of the data from the sensitive apps.

* An aid worker has lots of sensitive data about people on their device.  They regularly sync that data to a secure, central database.  Occasionally, the aid worker has to leave the country on very short notice.  The border guards regularly download the entire contents of mobile devices of people crossing through.  While waiting in line at the border, the aid worker sees the border guards seizing people's devices, and then remembers all the data on the device, so she unlocks the phone and hits the wipe trigger, which wipes all sensitive apps from the device. When the aid worker returns to the central office, the device is again synced up with the central database.

This project was started as part of the T2 Panic work.  Read more about it here:

Currently Poland, Lithuania and Latvia are supported. A data connection is required.

The actual data reported may vary between countries. Also, as RoadEagle needs to convert the data from different formats to TraFF, it may not be able to represent all traffic messages as intended by their creators.

This app receives requests from compatible apps (consumers) which may expose the device location (and, possibly, where you intend to travel). Because of the location information, consumer apps may refuse to send such requests to apps without location permission. This is the only thing RoadEagle uses this permission for; it will never request a location update.

If yours is missing, feel free to open a PR ;)

The holy mysteries are date-aware and should show the correct one depending on day-of-week and season. If it doesn't that's a bug, please let me know.

Here's a small summary

Monday	  - Joyful
Tuesday	  - Sorrowful
Wednesday - Glorious
Thursday  - Luminous
Friday	  - Sorrowful
Saturday  - Joyful
Sundays in Lent	  - Sorrowful
Sundays in Advent - Joyful

There are quite a few interpretations which prayers should be in the rosary so I decided to include more rather than less.
If you prefer not to pray the Fatima prayer (you should pray it) or the Hail Holy Queen you can just toggle them in the settings.

Shared storage is what you can see in the ""File Manager"" app that usually comes with
the device. This includes the 'DCIM' camera image folder as well as 'Downloads'.

When the ""start"" button is pressed and the device has Wifi connectivity, the app will
open a rsync server on a random port with a random tag (""module"" in rsync parlance).
It will display all necessary details on how to connect to that server while it is
running, e.g.

rsync://192.168.123.123:66671/abcdef/

Using a standard rsync client the server can then be interrogated and files moved back and
forth, i.e. to and from the phone. The benefit is that the transfers can be driven from
the client desktop, the keyboard and mouse interface of which making the process much
more convenient.

Note: This app has not been widely tested and should therefore be considered alpha quality.

It's designed to be as simple and intuitive as possible, while still delivering unique features that you'll actually use. Additionally, Saber is available across all your devices, large and small, and syncs between them seamlessly.

Notably, it can invert your notes when you're in dark mode. This allows you to write with white ink on a black background, which is much easier on the eyes in low-light environments like when the teacher turns off the lights in class.
Images and PDFs are also inverted, so you can still use a digital printout or a textbook without the fuss.

Saber uses a dual-password system to protect your notes from anyone but you, even if they have complete control over the server. You can safely store your notes on the official Saber server, another server, or even host your own!

The app is completely open-source so that anyone can view the source code and see exactly what it's doing and how it handles your data. Many other note-taking apps are closed-source and proprietary, meaning that their inner workings are a mystery to the public.

As someone who studies maths, highlighting multi-line equations was always a hassle with other apps, where the highlighter would change color when it overlapped with itself. Another problem I had was that in some apps, the highlighter would render on top of the text, fading it out and making it hard to read.
Saber's highlighter has no such issues. It utilizes canvas compositing to render the highlighter in a way that is consistent with/better than traditional paper, where it handles overlaps and maintains color consistency.

Saber has everything you need to keep your notes organized. Create folders inside folders inside folders to your heart's content with no limit on the number of nested folders. And even though a note may be buried deep within a nested folder, you can still access it easily with your most recent notes always available on the home screen.

Discover a whole new way to capture and organize your thoughts with Saber. Whether you're a student, professional, or creative mind, Saber is your trusted companion for digital handwriting. Download now and let your ideas flow freely!

<b>Application Field:</b>

* The SAF scanner can access USB memory devices, like USB sticks via OTG adapter, in Android 6, 7 and 8. Note that Android 9 and 10 natively allow (read) file access to USB memory, just like to SD cards.
* The SAF scanner can extract album art on SD cards and USB memory devices, this is currently not possible with the classical scanner, because without SAF it is limited to read-only access.
* The SAF scanner can access SMB or SFTP servers, if the respective document provider is installed.
* The SAF scanner even deals with non-seekable files by reading them completely into memory before further processing.

<b>Features:</b>

* Can be run manually whenever audio files have been added, removed or changed.
* Auto scan (incremental) or complete scan (rebuild) selectable.
* Various audio file types (mp3, mp4, flac, ogg, ...).
* Multi CD albums: sub-subdirectories ""CD1"", ""CD2"", ..., with common folder image.
* Common and non-common text tags.
* Composer and grouping (work, movements).
* Proprietary Apple iTunes tags for classical music.
* Extracting of embedded images if none already exists.
* Downscaling of both extracted and existing album images.
* Original images can be kept as backup, if desired.
* Maximum image size is configurable.
* Creates a standard SQLite database in <code>/ClassicalMusicDb</code> that can be accessed from PC or other apps.

★ Safe Notes encrypt each note with a unique AES-256 symmetric key derived from your passphrase and randomly generated salt.
★ If an attacker tries to brute-force your encrypted notes it will take ""Trillions Upon Trillions years"" in contrast, the universe has only existed for 15 billion years. (You must use strong and long passphrase).
★ AES-256 is symmetric key encryption that is quantum-resistant, i.e. it isn't vulnerable to quantum computers.
★ Everything is stored locally on the user's device.
★ Your passphrase is never stored on the device, it gets purged as soon as you exit the app.
★ We can't decrypt your notes even if we wanted to. That gives you the ultimate security, but it also means that a lost passphrase can never be recovered.

No problem! ,"Have you ever ran into this scenario: you are using an app (such as a bank app) and you need to export a file urgently (for example, a bank statement in PDF). You want to download that file locally in your device, but the app doesn't offer any easy way to do so, the max it offers is the option to share the file, meaning you end up having to send it to yourself (or somebody else) via email or a instant messaging app, to only then having the option to save that file.

This happens because many apps choose to use the system's share functionality instead of doing the work to implement the required file saving logic. So, what can be done?

In those cases Save Locally might come in handy, you just choose it on the share sheet that comes up and it allows you to save the file anywhere locally in your device, it also shows the file details beforehand (though that can be skipped).
An option to intercept ""Open with"" intents is also available, allowing you to save files even if the source app were to try force viewing with a default viewer for that file type.

Save Locally is FLOSS software (Free and Libre Open Source Software) developed with Jetpack Compose. Source code is available at <a href=""https://github.com/MateusRodCosta/SaveLocally"">https://github.com/MateusRodCosta/SaveLocally</a> licensed under AGPLv3+.

Note that this app requires the WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS permission that can be granted with EITHER a PC using ADB or root. Root is NOT required for this app, it is optional. Android 8.0+ is supported, with more features enabled on Android 10+.

Uninstalling the app will not reset the battery saver configuration. You must set the Default profile to undo all changes before uninstalling.

Features:
- Advertising to other apps that low power mode is enabled
- Android's data saver for metered WiFi or mobile data connections
- The built-in dark mode
- Launch boost to accelerate app starts
- Vibration
- Showing window and activity animations
- Allowing apps to use the SoundTrigger HAL

- Reducing the max brightness of the panel
- Forcing all apps into standby mode
- Forcing all apps to not check data in the background
- Disabling unnecessary sensors
- Using the Always-On-Display
- Putting the device into deep sleep as soon as the screen turns off

It also enables something called ""sticky"" low power mode. Usually, when the device is plugged in and unplugged, the low power mode is then disabled. However, sticky mode re-applies low power mode afterwards to continue saving battery.

Ziel des Spiels ist es, alle Schiffe des Gegners zu versenken, indem beide Spieler abwechselnd auf das Spielfeld des Gegners ""schießen"".

Das Spiel bietet zwei Spielmodi:
- Spieler vs Computer
- Spieler vs Spieler

Der Spieler kann dabei zwischen den Spielfeldgrößen 5x5 und 10x10 wählen und seine Schiffe frei platzieren. Die Anzahl der Schiffe kann vor dem Spiel selbst gewählt werden. Dabei sind Schiffe der Größen 2 (U-Boote), 3 (Zerstörer), 4 (Kreuzer) und 5 (Schlachtschiffe) möglich.

Was unterscheidet Privacy Friendly Schiffe Versenken von anderen, ähnlichen Apps?

1. Keine Berechtigungen
Privacy Friendly Schiffe versenken verwendet keine Berechtigungen.
Zum Vergleich: Die Top Ten ähnlicher Apps, die im Google Play Store erhältlich sind, benötigt durchschnittlich 6,1 Berechtigungen (Stand: November 2017). Hierzu zählen der Zugriff auf Netzwerke, das Internet oder Standortdaten.

2. Keine störende Werbung
Viele andere kostenlose Apps im Google Play Store blenden störende Werbung ein, die unter anderem auch die Akkulaufzeit verkürzt und Datenvolumen verbrauchen kann.

Die App gehört zur Gruppe der Privacy Friendly Apps, die von der Forschungsgruppe SECUSO der Technischen Universität Darmstadt entwickelt werden. Mehr Informationen unter: https://secuso.org/pfa

<b>Translations</b>

If you wish to help to translate this app to your own language, you can do so by translating these two projects using transifex:
https://www.transifex.com/juanitobananas/scrambled-exif/ and https://www.transifex.com/juanitobananas/libcommon/.

<b>Misc Stuff and Facts</b>

★ Basically, Exif is used by jpeg, which is the format in which your Android camera saves pictures. If you want to know more about Exif, check the Wikipedia.

★ Scrambled Exif also renames the files (this can be disabled).

★ Please don't heavily rely on the data being deleted. Scrambled Exif does its job pretty well, but it could fail. Always double-check before you share.

★ It doesn't really <i>scramble</i> the Exif data, it deletes it. So the name is probably stupid. But I like it. The icon doesn't depict scrambled eggs either. So the icon is probably stupid. But I like it. And I also happen to be a huge fan of eggs. So this app doesn't only have a stupid name and an equally stupid icon, it is also my (non-stupid) tribute to eggs. Especially <i>huevos fritos</i>. Because I love them.

* Your storage is collecting files and folders you don't recognize.

Let’s not go on here… Let SD Maid 2/SE help you!

SD Maid 2/SE is an app and file manager that specializes in knowing which apps have created specific files on your device. SD Maid 2/SE searches your device and compares files with installed apps to offer options for safely freeing up storage space.

✨ Clean up after uninstalling apps
If apps create files outside their designated folders then files can remain even after uninstalling the apps. The ""CorpseFinder"" tool finds app remnants, tells you to which app they belonged and helps you delete them.

🔍 Search your device the smart way
Filter for empty folders, temporary files, already installed apps and more. You can even create your own search criteria. The ""SystemCleaner"" tool allows you to automatically search your device and delete files based on various criteria.

🧹 Delete expendable files and hidden caches
Thumbnails, trash bins, offline caches and more: If apps don't clean up after themselves, then this app will. The ""AppCleaner"" tool finds apps with expendable files.

📦 Manage all of your apps
Get a comprehensive list of all apps installed on your device. Enabled, disabled, user or system app: no app can hide from you. The ""AppControl"" tool is an app manager that allows you to search, sort and control your apps.

📊 What is using all your space
Storage management can be complex with apps, media, system, and other files across phone storage, SD cards, and USB devices. ""StorageAnalyzer"" is a file manager that displays how space is used on your device, simplifying your storage management.

📷 Find duplicate data
Duplicate downloads, photos sent through social media or just similar pictures of the same scene: Over time copies can accumulate. The ""Deduplicator"" tool finds files that are exactly the same or similar and helps you delete extra copies.

This app is ad-free. Some features require a paid upgrade.

SD Maid 2/SE is the successor to SD Maid 1/Legacy.
Optimized for newer Android versions and focused on cleaning up.

This app has optional features that utilize the AccessibilityService API to automate tedious actions.
Using the AccessibilityService API, this app can click buttons for you to perform operations on multiple apps, e.g. deleting caches.
This app does not use the AccessibilityService API to collect information.

**DISCLAIMER**
This is currently a very small and spontaneous project released in the hopes of being useful. While i take my best care to design this application to be stable and never harmful, i cannot guarantee any kind of safety. Use of this application happens on your own risk and discretion, especially since i can only test the application on the few devices that i own. If in major doubt, you might want to test the functionality of the app on your device with an unimportant SD Card first to eliminate any possiblity of data loss.
That being said, there's currently nothing destructive going on and misbehavior should entirely be limited to failure of enabling write access. Anything this app might currently do wrong if running on a wrong device should entirely be revertable by uninstalling it and remounting your SD Card.


**What is this**
With android 4.4, Google decided that it would be time for a new and fancy way to access your internal storage and introduced the Storage Access Framework (SAF). You might have had some contact with it over time.
Sadly, with this new feature Google also decided to remove SD Card write access like it used to exist, forcing every app to go through SAF if they want to write something to the SD Card. This required each developer to update their apps. Until this day, some apps still do not support the SAF.

This app aims at allowing those apps to write to your SD Card again. It uses a method that should work on android 8.0 and above which involves remounting the SD Card, hence the name.

**Requirements:**

* A device with an SD Card slot
* Root access, since the app remounts some stuff
* Android 8.0 or later (but if you are running android 6.0.1, 7.0 or 7.1, it shouldn't hurt to just give it a shot)

The approach currently used by this app definitely only applies to devices running android 6 or later. It has successfully been tested with devices running android 8.1, 9 and 10 and unsucsessfully on devices running android 7.1, 6.0.1 and 5.1.
With android 10 & 11, storage access became more restricted, forcing all newer apps to go through SAF. It remains to be seen what this does to legacy storage access and this app, and what's to come with even newer android versions.

For more information, have a look at the [README](https://gitlab.com/giwiniswut/android-media-rw-remounter/-/blob/master/README.md) and the [Wiki](https://gitlab.com/giwiniswut/android-media-rw-remounter/-/wikis/Home).

**How to use it:**

* Install
* Launch once
* Grant permanent root access
* Insert or remount some storage
* Start writing files to the SD Card

**Notes:**

* The app must be launched at least once or else the system won't ever run it. This is a security mechanism of the Android platform to protect users from apps they've never launched and maybe never wanted to use or install.
* This restriction can be removed by installing the app as a privileged app, i.e. by writing the apk file to `/system/priv-app`.
* Upon the first mount with this app installed, i.e. when you actively need to grant root access, it is possible that the app will do nothing. This is because the app will currently be terminated if it has to wait more than a few seconds for root access. Once root access has already been granted and the app is immediately given root access every time it needs it, everything should work as expected.


**How do i know if my device is compatible?**
TL;DR: Just give it a shot.
Ultimately, this app relies on how your specific device vendor chose to implement how your SD Card gets mounted and by which method write access gets removed. With pure android (AOSP), the approach with simple remounting of the SD Card will work from android 8.0 and above, where it uses `sdcardfs` to do the job, a special filesystem originally developed by Samsung. If you have a Samsung device, it's very much possible that it already uses `sdca",1

    Import a key using a QR code in “Import key via QR” under key management.

File Encryption/Decryption

    Select files from your device.
    Encrypt or decrypt them using the same algorithms.
    The output file name is automatically labeled “.encrypted” or “.decrypted.”

Built-In Key Manager :key:

    Add, delete, or generate random keys.
    Import keys from QR codes or export them as QR codes too.
    Keys are stored securely (using EncryptedSharedPreferences).

    Quick and convenient for multi-app workflows.

Optional Accessibility Service :handshake:

    Detects selected text (when you highlight text on-screen).
    Detects copied text (clipboard).
    Displays a notification to encrypt/decrypt on the fly, opening the same activity (DialogFlowEncryptionActivity) with “Choose Operation.”

Toggle Accessibility Logic

    A “BurbujaEncryption” button (or similar) enables/disables the logic internally without turning off the service in Android Settings.
    Perfect for pausing detection without leaving system settings.

Dialog Flow (DialogFlowEncryptionActivity) :speech_balloon:

    A step-by-step sequence:
        “Choose Operation” (Encrypt/Decrypt)
        “Choose Cipher”
        “Pick/Enter Key”
        Final result
    Offers a guided, user-friendly experience.

Android 13+ Support

    Requests POST_NOTIFICATIONS permission if you want to see notifications when text is selected or copied.

Basic Usage :rocket:
Main Screen

    Enter text and a key (or pick a saved key).
    Select the algorithm from the spinner.
    Tap Encrypt or Decrypt.
    Copy or share the resulting text.

File Encryption :file_folder:

    Tap “FILE ENCRYPTION” on the main screen (MainActivity).
    Choose a file and an output folder.
    Pick the algorithm and a key.
    Tap EXECUTE.

Accessibility (Optional)

    Enable it in Settings → Accessibility → “Encrypt-DecrypT Service.”
    Once enabled, selecting or copying text in any app triggers a notification.
    Tap it to open the DialogFlow (“Choose Operation”).
    In MainActivity, use “BurbujaEncryption” to enable or disable detection without turning the service off in Settings.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) :question:

    How do I enable/disable the accessibility service logic without going to system settings?
        Use the “BurbujaEncryption” button in MainActivity. It toggles an internal SharedPreferences flag. If disabled, the service won’t process events even if it’s still enabled in system settings.

    What if I forget my key?
        You won’t be able to decrypt your text/file. Make sure you keep a record of your keys or store them in the Key Manager.

    Why am I not seeing notifications when copying text?
        On Android 13+, you must grant the POST_NOTIFICATIONS permission.
        Check that the accessibility service is enabled and the internal logic is not toggled off.

Unfortunally the original BMW Connected-app does not show up here.
Here is where 'send2car' comes into play - is an app capable or receiving intents for the geo-url-sheme and translating this event into a connected-drive message to be send to your car. As Geo-intends besides the coordinates do not contain much detail when receiving such geo-url-intent send2car will do some reverse-geocoding to retrieve additional data and offer to send the result to a bmw car via the services provides by the BMW Connected-drive portal. The message being send to the car is equivalent to message that is sent from the Map that you can find in Connected-drive app or portal. Actually send2car does use the very same web-services that the connected-drive-portal web-app uses.
When opening the message in your cars head-unit you can choose to navigate to the precise location that is encoded within the message.
To use you need to configure your connected-drive accout in send2car and retrieve the associated VINs from connected-drive portal.

WARNING -- I do not guarantee that problems caused by the improper use of this utility can be fixed, and we are unable to help you with any such problems. We support only this app, not your device's system software. Settings Database Editor (SetEdit) is invaluable if you need it, but if you're not careful you're very likely to mess something up.

By default, for your protection, Android prevents you from modifying the SECURE and GLOBAL tables. If you have Android Jellybean or later, you can remove this protection from an ADB shell using the command ""pm grant io.github.muntashirakon.setedit android.permission.WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS"". On earlier versions, you can only remove this protection on a rooted device by installing SetEdit to the system partition.

Both WRITE_SETTINGS and WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS permissions are optional if you do not need to edit any items.

This app needs to target API 22 because API 23 (Android M) onwards do not allow it to modify some setting items without elevated permissions such as root or ADB.

In Android 14 onwards, a new restriction has been added that prevents an app targeting API 22 or earlier to be installed without elevated permission.
You can install the application from an ADB shell using the following command:

adb install --bypass-low-target-sdk-block SetEdit.apk

Or, from a rooted shell:

pm install --bypass-low-target-sdk-block SetEdit.apk

After selecting a language and going through the intro, you can see the sharing buttons and the history of files you shared on the main screen. You can share images, files, installed apps, or simply text. After selecting the file, you will be shown the Sharing screen. Here you can see your connectivity status (Wi-Fi/Mobile Hotspot) and the URL you need to open on the other device. After typing this URL in the browser and hitting Enter on the other machine, the file will start downloading. Please make sure that both devices are connected to the same network.


If you have Sharik installed on both devices, you can simply click the button ""Receive"" on the bottom panel of the app. After clicking, the Receiver screen will be shown. If Sharik detects another device sharing a file in your local network, it will be displayed. If you click on it, the browser will appear, and the download will start.


Sharik is entirely free to use, and it contains no ads. Moreover, its source code is published on GitHub so that everyone can contribute to the development process. So, if you like it, please leave a star on our GitHub repository, and consider contributing: add a new language or help us with code.


Sharik was built using Flutter. It is published under an open license (MIT).

The main use-cases of Shelter include:

- Installing apps inside a work profile for isolation
- ""Freeze"" apps inside the work profile to prevent them from running or being woken up when you are not actively using them
- Installing two copies of the same app on the same device

Note that Shelter depends on the Work Profile feature of the Android system, so any bugs related to Work Profiles in the Android-derived system you are using will affect Shelter. In addition, Shelter can only be as secure as the Work Profile implementation.

Due to Android limitations, this app requires root (as on all Unixoid operating systems, it is not possible to open a port < 1024 otherwise, and the default SMB port is 445 and Windows doesn't work with anything else). Without root, you either need some sort of SMB client which allows configuring the port used (SimbaDroid uses port 4450 behind the scenes), or some kind of port mapping software to allow Windows to transparently connect to port 4450.

Due to JFileServer limitations, only SMBv1 is supported, which isn't ideal for modern Windows, either, but c'est la vie…

Since the app is mostly for my private use, at the moment there are no configuration options – shares for the internal storage as well as an external SD card (if one is detected) are set up automatically and are accessible without authentication, so be careful about using this app in public networks. I might add some options for configuring your own custom shares and user authentication eventually, but no guarantees as to if and when.

Your calls are fully encrypted and tap-proof. Simlar is very easy to use. Just select your contact and call them! After installation, all of your contacts who also use Simlar will be listed in the app automatically. Maybe some of your friends already have Simlar. If not, you can invite them easily. Simlar is also available for iPhones.

Simlar is based on the established end-to-end encryption protocol ZRTP. No one can listen to your conversation, not even us. During your first call, you need to match a short code with the person you are speaking to. This protects against man-in-the-middle attacks and only needs to be done once per contact.

The app development is driven by the open source community. You can find the source code at simlar.org.

Simlar is free of charge. All you need is an internet connection. The more stable it is, the better your sound quality. The average “traffic” corresponds to 1 megabyte for a 2-minute call. For more details see simlar.org.

Newly installed apps from the suite will automagically receive the shared colors too.

Please keep the app installed at least for a day, to avoid getting automatically refunded.

This app is not a replacement for the Pro app versions. You will still have to purchase them separately, in case you want to use them.

It comes with material design and dark theme by default, provides great user experience for easy usage. The lack of internet access gives you more privacy, security and stability than other apps.

********************************************************************************************

<p><b>SimpleLogin</b> is an open source solution to protect your email inbox. It allows you to create quickly a random email address (aka alias). All emails sent to an alias are forwarded to your personal email address. You can use the alias when subscribing to a newsletter, signing up for a new account, giving your email to someone you don't trust. Not only an alias can receive emails, it can also send emails. An alias is a full-fledged email address. Later you can simply block or delete an alias if it's too spammy.</p>

<b>Why SimpleLogin?</b>
When you give away your personal email online, there is a good chance that your email address would end up with a spammer or a hacker. SimpleLogin acts as a firewall to protect your personal email inbox.

<b>What distinguishes SimpleLogin:</b>

<ul>
<li>Open-source and easy to self-host. The self-hosting is based on Docker and could be run on almost any Linux server. The hosting instruction is on our repository at <a href=""https://github.com/simple-login/app"">https://github.com/simple-login/app</a></li>
<li>Powerful features if you have a domain (only available at premium plan).</li>
<li>Generous free plan: there's no cap on bandwidth or number of replies/sends. The Free Plan is enough for protecting your personal email. Premium Plan targets at more ""advanced"" users with features like custom domain, unlimited alias or catch-all alias.</li>
<li>Open Roadmap with exciting upcoming features: email directory, extension for Safari, mobile applications, etc. Feel free to check it out on <a href=""https://trello.com/b/4d6A69I4/open-roadmap"">https://trello.com/b/4d6A69I4/open-roadmap</a></li>

  <li><strong>Complete protection against spam and abuse</strong>: as you have no identifier on SimpleX platform, you cannot be contacted unless you share a one-time invitation link or an optional temporary user address.</li>
  <li><strong>Full ownership, control and security of your data</strong>: SimpleX stores all user data on client devices, the messages are only held temporarily on SimpleX relay servers until they are received.</li>
  <li><strong>Decentralized network</strong>: you can use SimpleX with your own servers and still communicate with people using the servers that are pre-configured in the apps or any other SimpleX servers.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can connect to anybody you know via link or scan QR code (in the video call or in person) and start sending messages instantly - no emails, phone numbers or passwords needed.</p> 
<p>Your profile and contacts are only stored in the app on your device - our servers do not have access to this information.</p>
<p>All messages are end-to-end encrypted using open-source double-ratchet protocol; the messages are routed via our servers using open-source SimpleX Messaging Protocol.</p>

Use it to identify stars, planets, nebulae and more. Originally developed as Google Sky Map, it has now been donated and open sourced.

<b>Troubleshooting/FAQ</b>

<i>The Map doesn't move/points in the wrong place</i>
Make sure you haven't switched into manual mode. Does your phone have a compass? If not, Sky Map cannot tell your orientation. Look it up here: http://www.gsmarena.com/

Try calibrating your compass by moving it in a figure of 8 motion or as described here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1EPbAapaeI.

Are there any magnets or metal nearby that might interfere with the compass?

Try switching off ""magnetic correction"" (in settings) and see if that is more accurate.

<i>Why is autolocation not supported for my phone?</i>
In Android 6 the way permissions work has changed. You need to enable the location permission setting for Sky Map as described here: https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/6270602?p=app_permissons_m

<i>The Map is jittery</i>
Try adjusting the sensor speed and damping (in settings). We have a better solution coming soon!

<i>Do I need an internet connection?</i>
No, but some functions (like entering your location manually) won't work without one. You'll have to use the GPS or enter a latitude and longitude instead.

Its goal is to move all cards to the foundations. A detailed description of the rules can be found in the app's help site.

Which features offers Privacy Friendly Solitaire?

Privacy Friendly Solitaire provides different difficulty levels that draw either one or three cards from the deck. Additionally there are the following versions of counting points:
- None: No points are counted.
- Standard: The Player starts with zero points, moves give different points.
- Vegas: The Player starts at -52 points and tries to get more than zero points, while the deck can only be passed through one time.

The Player can generate an automatic move by clicking the Hint-Button or automatically move all possible cards to the foundation by shaking the device (if it is activated in the Settings).
Addtionally he can undo and redo moves. Optionally he is shown the time of play.
When the game is almost won (meaning that there are no more cards turned face-down), it will finish automatically.

How does Privacy Friendly Solitaire differ from other similar apps?

1) No permissions
Privacy Friendly Solitaire does not require any permission.
For comparison: The Top Ten similar apps from the Google Play Store, require an average of 11,1 permissions (March 2018). These are for instance the permission to access accounts, permissions to access, modify or delete storage and access to networks or the internet.

2) No advertisement
Moreover, Privacy Friendly Solitaire distinguishes from many other applications in the way that it completely relinquishes advertisements. Advertisement might track a user's actions. It could also shorten battery life or use mobile data.

This app is part of the Privacy Friendly Apps group
developed by the research group SECUSO at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology.

This fixes problems with some Bluetooth speakers where, following silence, the speaker misses the first part of the next sound that is played. This is most apparent with intermittent sounds, such as speech. For example, when listening to an audiobook, the first part of each sentence may often be missed.

Playing a quiet (almost inaudible) noise on these speakers at all times prevents any periods of total silence and so avoids this problem.

The sound will play automatically while you are connected to certain Bluetooth devices, as chosen in the settings. Alternatively, you can temporarily play or pause the sound in the upper toolbar.

The app was created to solve a common problem: charging your phone in public spaces while traveling or camping. When you need to leave your phone unattended at a public charging spot, Stay Put acts as your guard. It sounds a loud alarm if someone unplugs your device, deterring potential theft.

Stay Put is free software. It is published under the MIT open-source license.

CORE FEATURES
-------------

- Loud alarm when device is unplugged
- Secure disarm with biometric authentication or device credentials
- Option to allow disarm by plugging the device back to power
- No tracking, no data collection

FAQ
---

WHEN SHOULD I USE STAY PUT?
Stay Put is ideal when charging your phone in public spaces like:
- Public libraries
- Hostels
- Campground bathrooms
- Airport charging stations
- Any shared charging area

HOW DOES STAY PUT PREVENT THEFT?
Stay Put doesn't physically prevent theft, but it acts as a deterrent. The moment someone unplugs your phone, a loud alarm sounds. The alarm can only be disabled using your biometric data or device credentials – or by plugging the device back to power (if this option is enabled).

CAN I STILL USE MY PHONE WHILE STAY PUT IS ACTIVE?
Yes, Stay Put runs in the background and doesn't interfere with normal phone usage. Just remember to disarm it before unplugging your phone.",1

All data is kept locally only, there is no connection to any server. For statistics you can save your data locally on SD-Card.

Please note: Pressure sensor is mandatory. Steps will not be counted during walking, if there is a step sensor but no pressure sensor. 
Elevation gain should only be counted if footsteps are detected, so only stairs and hill climbing will count, but not elevators or lifts. Don’t expect high accuracy - due to the concept of the sensors the accuracy is limited. And: avoid walking in trains or subways with active measurement, as the pressure (and therefore height) can change significantly during driving. 

You can save regular and daily statistics automatically on SD-Card and save current values with the floating action button. Starting with Android 10 files are not saved to root-folder of SD-card anymore, but in app-directory. There isn’t much on graphical display of statistic data besides two progress bars. Just use any program which can read csv-values. 

<b>Permissions:</b>
* Access to physical activity: Access to step sensor needs permission to access physical activity since Android 10+. The app will not work without this permission on devices with Android 10 and higher.
* Keep device awake: Device will not be kept awake all time. It will be woken up regulary and kept awake if necessary for short time to ensure proper counting of steps and elevation gain.
* Write to external storage: App will work without this permission, but you cannot save statistical values or markers.

The goal is to fill the complete board with numbers. Every number may only occur once in every column, row and subsection.

Privacy Friendly Sudoku has three different game modes:
1. a 6x6 game field with 2x3 subsections
2. a 9x9 game field with 3x3 subsections
3. a 12x12 game field with 3x4 subsections

For each game mode there are four different difficulty levels that are not measured by the number of preset values, but rather by the solving strategies needed to solve the game. The generator always tries to provide a game that has the minimum amount of preset values needed to solve the game. Additionally, users can create their own custom sudokus of arbitrary difficulty for each of the three game modes.

Sudokus can be shared with other users by using the available import and export functions. Another community feature is the 'daily sudoku', which is newly generated each day and the same for every user of the app.

The app can be used in both light and dark mode.

Our Privacy Friendly App differs from other applications with respect to two aspects:
1. The Privacy Friendly Sudoku App does not use any permission.
2. The Privacy Friendly Sudoku App completely relinquishes advertisement.
Many other free apps in the Google Play Store dazzle annoying advertising and also shortens battery life.

<li>Especially useful while you are on a tour, where you need only some apps but a long battery life</li>

<p>SuperFreezZ is not yet another task manager promising to delete 10 GB of data per month or making your device 2x as fast. This is impossible.</p>

Also, these apps will take longer to start when you use them the next time: SuperFreezZ will super freeze your apps, it takes about 1-3 seconds to un-freeze them. Greenify has the same disadvantages, except that the author of Greenify does not warn you about it. So: Just do not overdo it, and SuperFreezZ will be super useful.</p>
<p>Examples for apps that deserve to be frozen:</p>

Instead of dividing the day into 24 hours, it divides it into 1000 .beat's. 6:00 AM becomes ""@250"", 11:27 PM becomes ""@977"" and so on! In addition to that, there are no timezones in Internet Time. It's the same all over the world. It's based on Biel Mean Time (BMT), similar to Central European Time (CET).

Of course, getting used to this new format might not be easy, and even when you learn it, you will still need a .beat clock.

* Folder, device and overall sync progress can easily be read off the UI.
* ""Syncthing Camera"" - an optional feature (with optional permission to use the camera) where you can take pictures with your friend, partner, ... on two phones into one shared and private Syncthing folder. No cloud involved. - FEATURE CURRENTLY IN BETA STAGE -
* ""Sync every hour"" to save even more battery
* Individual sync conditions can be applied per device and per folder
* Recent changes UI, click to open files.
* Changes to folder and device config can be made regardless if Syncthing is running or not
* UI explains why syncthing is running or not.
* ""Battery eater"" problem is fixed.
* Discover other Syncthing devices on the same network and easily add them.
* Supports two-way synchronization on external SD card since Android 11.

Syncthing-Fork for Android is a wrapper for Syncthing that provides an Android UI instead of Syncthing's built-in Web UI. Syncthing replaces proprietary sync and cloud services with something open, trustworthy and decentralized. Your data is your data alone and you deserve to choose where it is stored, if it is shared with some third party and how it's transmitted over the Internet.

Goals of the fork:
* Develop and try out enhancements together with the community.
* Release the wrapper more frequently to identify and fix bugs caused by changes in the syncthing submodule
* Make enhancements configurable in the UI, users should be able to turn them on and off

Comparison between upstream and fork at the time of writing this:
* Both contain the syncthing binary built from the official source at GitHub
* Syncing functionality and reliability depends on the syncthing binary submodule version.
* Fork gets along with upstream and sometimes they pick up my improvements.
* Strategy and release frequency is different
* Only the wrapper containing the Android UI is addressed by the fork.

Once installed you must enable the keyboard in your Android Settings (System -> Languages & input -> Virtual keyboard -> Manage keyboards).

Each key has one main character (shown in a larger and darker font on the left) and one or more secondary characters (shown in a smaller and lighter font on the right). Depending on the gesture you use on the key it will produce different characters:
- When tapped, a key will produce its main character.
- When flinged (swiped quickly in a direction) a key will produce the secondary character that is in that direcion.
- When long-pressed, new keys will appear with extra characters related to those on the main key. Tapping on any of these keys will produce the corresponding character.

For example, the second key in the first row (with a large ""2"" on the left and ""a<sup>b</sup>c"" on the right) will produce a ""2"" when tapped, an ""a"" when flinged left, a ""b"" when flinged up, and a ""c"" when flinged right. When long-pressed it will show new keys ""á"", ""à"", ""â"", ""ä"", ""ã"", and ""ç"".

There are some exceptions to these rules:
- The ""0"" key only has one secondary character, which is space. No matter which direction you fling it, it will always produce a whitespace.
- The shift key (⇪) has two special functions associated to its fling: when flinged up it will turn on Caps Lock, and when flinged down it will turn it off.
- The backspace key (⇦) and the enter key (➡) always do the same thing, no matter if you tap them or fling them.",1

Just find a coin or other reference object of a known size, put it next to the item you want measured and take a picture. Make sure all objects are in the same level and the picture is taken perpendicularly to it. Now you can mark the reference object in the picture and measure any length or area you want!

Privacy Friendly Tape Measure belongs to the Privacy Friendly Apps group developed by the research group SECUSO at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. More information can be found an https://secuso.org/pfa

Privacy Friendly Tape Measure can also display rulers or a protractor on the screen. Use this to quickly measure small objects or to cut a pizza in six equal slices. Yum!

What makes Privacy Friendly Tape Measure different from other similar apps?

1. Fewer permissions
Privacy Friendly Tape Measure uses only the Read External Storage permission. It needs it because most pictures on your phone are located on the SD-card as opposed to the internal phone memory.

2. No advertisement
Many other free apps in the Google Play Store dazzle you with annoying advertisements which also shorten battery life.

The game mechanics are very simple. You have to tap as many hamsters, randomly appearing on a board, as you can. For each tapped hamster you get 10 points. For each missed hamster you lose 100 points. Additionally, tapping a bunny causes a loss of 1000 points. Difficulty gradually rises over time, as everything gets surprisingly faster.

Several proprietary parts were removed from the original Telegram client, including Google Play Services for the location services, HockeySDK for self-updates and push notifications through Google Cloud Messaging. Location sharing functionality is restored using OpenStreetMap.

Anti-Feature: Non-Free Network, since the servers run proprietary software.

The official source code of the app contains binary blobs, so this tracks a fork which builds those from source. Hence, versions might become available with a certain lag.

Also it requires a minimum of knowledge of how the Android GUI works.
See <a href=""https://github.com/termux/termux-gui/blob/main/README.md"">the README</a> for a crash course.

Features:
* Display content in a task with its own back stack
* Display custom dialogs

* Create your own homescreen widgets
* Use <a href=""https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/picture-in-picture"">picture-in-picture mode</a>
* Get events from the UI and change the content on-the-fly
* Draw to a buffer on the screen directly

The feature list will keep on growing. Let me know if you have any ideas.

Current Features
1. Text unsaved numbers in WhatsApp - Often we find ourselves needing to text/send file/share location to someone for temporary purposes (if you ask me, I face this a lot in situations where I go to a printing centre where they ask me to share the file that I want to print over WhatsApp, so I have to save their contact, refresh my WhatsApp contact list and then send them). Having a context menu option to directly open a WhatsApp chat from their phone number would save a lot of time and keep your phonebook clean, right?
2. Evaluate mathematical expressions inline - We may often find ourselves to mathematically calculate something while texting someone (probably while making plans). Having an option to perform math calculations in line without needing to open calculator could save time.
3. Transform text - Transform the selected text inline. Supported transformations include changing the case, wrapping it with text etc.
4. Text count - Get detailed analysis about character count, word count, letter count and more for the selected text.
5. Save text to a file - Lets you save the selected text into a file so that it can be accessed later.
6. Find & Replace - Quickly find certain text and replace them with text of your choice within the selected text.

Where are screenshots?
The app adds capabilities to text selection wherever supported in the Android System, there is nothing much to do inside the app, hence very less screenshots.

Installation Warning
While installing the app (you have to sideload), Google Play may block the installation saying it has never seen the app before. While it is true (from Google Play POV), kindly proceed with installing the app. If you have doubts about the app being malicious, you are free to verify the same from the source code (it would not be open-source if the app was malicious in the first place, right?).",1

This version is a fork from "" https://github.com/session-foundation/session-android "", enfocado en la privacidad.

## How Did ThreadScoopOnionChat Come About?

I have always been a fan of privacy and security in communications, and I am constantly researching potential security breaches in messaging applications.
ThreadScoopOnionChat emerged after the analysis of this blog ""https://soatok.blog/2025/01/14/dont-use-session-signal-fork/"", in which several aspects are described as to why using Session is not recommended, and I wondered how it is possible that a foundation focused on privacy—with the grants and support it receives—has not been able to improve this protocol.
I still do not understand the answer, since my resources are much smaller than those of a foundation compared to that of a person who is simply a fan of privacy and security.
In this blog, certain problems were described:

1> ""https://soatok.blog/2025/01/14/dont-use-session-signal-fork/#insufficient-entropy-ed25519""
2> ""https://soatok.blog/2025/01/14/dont-use-session-signal-fork/#in-band-negotiation""
3> ""https://soatok.blog/2025/01/14/dont-use-session-signal-fork/#public-keys-aes-gcm""


This is a forked version privacy focussed from Session.

Threema is the world’s best-selling secure messenger and keeps your data out of the hands of hackers, corporations, and governments. The service can be used completely anonymously. Threema is open source and offers every feature one would expect from a state-of-the-art instant messenger. The app also allows you to make end-to-end encrypted voice, video, and group calls. Using the desktop app and the web client, you can also use Threema from your desktop.

In contrast to the version distributed via Google Play, Threema Libre contains no proprietary libraries / components (like Google Play Services).

<strong>PRIVACY AND ANONYMITY</strong>

Threema is designed from the ground up to generate as little data on servers as possible. Group memberships and contact lists are managed on your device only and never stored on our servers. Messages are immediately deleted after they have been delivered. Local files are stored encrypted on your mobile phone or tablet. All this effectively prevents the collection and misuse of your personal information, including metadata. Threema is fully compliant with the European privacy legislation (GDPR).

<strong>ROCK-SOLID ENCRYPTION</strong>

Threema end-to-end encrypts all your communication, including messages, voice and video calls, group chats, files, and even status messages. Only the intended recipient, and nobody else, can read your messages. Threema uses the trusted open source NaCl cryptography library for encryption. The encryption keys are generated and safely stored on the users’ devices to prevent backdoor access or copies.

<strong>COMPREHENSIVE FEATURES</strong>

Threema is not only an encrypted and private messenger but also versatile and feature-rich.

· Write text and send voice messages
· Edit and delete sent messages on the recipient’s end
· Make voice, video and group calls
· Share videos pictures and locations
· Send any type of file (pdf animated gif, mp3, doc, zip, etc.)
· Use the desktop app or the web client to chat from your computer
· Create groups
· Conduct polls with the poll feature
· Choose between a dark and a light theme
· Quickly and silently reply with the unique agree/disagree feature
· Verify the identity of a contact by scanning their personal QR code
· Use Threema as anonymous instant messaging tool
· Synchronize your contacts (optional)

<strong>SERVERS IN SWITZERLAND</strong>

All our servers are located in Switzerland, and we develop our software in-house.

<strong>FULL ANONYMITY</strong>

Each Threema user receives a random Threema ID for identification. A phone number or email address is not required to use Threema. This unique feature allows you to use Threema completely anonymously – no need to give up private information or to open an account.

<strong>OPEN SOURCE AND AUDITS</strong>

The source code of the Threema app is open for everyone to review. On top of that, renowned experts are regularly commissioned to conduct systematic security audits of Threema’s code.

<strong>NO ADS, NO TRACKERS</strong>

Threema is not financed by advertising and does not collect user data.

It features a <b>3x3 grid layout</b>, and uses swipes for the less common letters. Its easy to learn, and designed for fast typing speeds.

Instead of relying on profit-driven, privacy-offending word and sentence prediction for accuracy, as do most popular phone keyboards like Gboard and Swiftkey, Thumb-Key uses <b>large keys with predictable positions</b>, to prevent your eyes from hunting and pecking for letters.

As the key positions get ingrained into your muscle memory, eventually you'll be able to appromixate the fast speeds of touch-typing, your eyes never having to leave the text edit area.

Features:

* Text-to-Image Search - Simply type in a description of the image you are looking for, and TIDY will retrieve the most relevant matches from your local image library. Text-to-Image search functionality in TIDY goes beyond traditional keyword-based searches! You can use longer and more detailed descriptions to find the exact image you have in mind.
* Image-to-Image Search - Search for visually similar images by choosing a photo from your device's gallery. TIDY will analyze the image and retrieve images with similar visual features, allowing you to explore and discover new images in a whole new way.

First launch:
During the first launch TIDY will need to scan through your photo library and create an index of your images. This indexing process may take some time, but it's a one-time event. Once this initial indexing process is complete, the app will store the index on your device, and any new photos you add to your photo library will be automatically added to the index on the subsequent app launches.

With this app, you won't have to move your sore arms and fingers, you can just set a timer, and the phone will turn off after a while!

Android does not have any simple way to power off the phone without root, so the best we can do is emulate the manual gestures used to shut down the phone. To do this, the app will use the accessibility permission, but it will not register any user's data.

Apps are grouped to categories (a category can contain one or multiple App).

You can chose per category at which times it should be allowed. This allows preventing playing games too late.

Additionally, you can configure time limit rules. These rules limit the total usage duration at one day or over multiple days (e.g. a weekend). It is possible to combine both, e.g. 2 hours per week end day, but in total only 3 hours.

Moreover, there is the possibility to set an extra time. This allows using something longer than regulary once. This can be used as bonus. There is additionally the option to disable all time limits temporarily (e.g. for the whole day or an hour).

Multi user support

There is the scenario that one device is used by exactly one user. However, with tablets, there are often multiple possible users. Due to that, it is possible to create multiple user profiles in TimeLimit. Each user has got different settings and time counters. There are two kinds of users: parents and children. If a parent was chosen as user, then there are no restrictions. Parents can chose any other user as current user. Children can only chose themselves as current user. 

Multi device support

There are scenarios in which one user has got multiple devices. Instead of time limits per device and splitting the limits across the devices, it is possible to assign one user to multiple devices.
Then the usage durations are counted together and allowing an App automatically affects all devices. Depending on the settings, only one device per time can be used or multiple devices at the same time. However, un the second case, it is possible to use more time than available e.g. at connection interruptions.

Connected

It is possible to view and change settings from any linked device. This connection is possible - if wanted - using your server.

Notes

Some features cost money if you don't use your own server. These features cost 1 € per month/ 10 € per year (in Germany).

TimeLimit does not work good at some smartphone brands (mostly Huawei and Wiko). With the correct settings, it can work better. But better is not good.

If it ""does not work"": This can be caused by power saving features. You can find at https://dontkillmyapp.com/ how you can disable these features. Get in touch with the support if that does not help.

TimeLimit uses the permission for the usage stats access. This is only used to detect the currently used App. Based on the currently used App, the App is blocked, allowed, or the remaining time is calculated.

The device admin permission is used to detect an uninstallation of TimeLimit.

TimeLimit uses the notification access to block notifications of blocked apps and to count and block background playback. Notifications and their contents are not saved.

TimeLimit uses an accessibility service to press the home button before showing the lock screen. This fixes blocking in some cases. Moreover, this allows opening the lockscreen at newer Android versions.

TimeLimit uses the permission ""draw over other Apps"" to allow opening the lockscreen at newer android versions and to overlay blocked Apps until the lockscreen is launched.

TimeLimit uses the location access to detect the used WiFi network and allow/ block Apps depending on it and your settings. The location access is not used otherwise.

If the connected mode is used, then TimeLimit may transmit the usage durations and - if enabled - the installed Apps to the parent user.

Supports Android 1.0+

It allows you to play audio and video files, like how you expected to. Most importantly it is designed in hope to make it compatible with different Android versions.
Its usage is as easy as opening or sharing the file you want to play with the app, or selecting it directly from the app. Enjoy your music!
This project is a branch from Little Music Player, but intended to be as small as possible, with only basic function.

You can find most information about Tiny Music Player just below.

Notices

The app will not be able to function properly without notification permissions being granted.
For Android 13+, due to new notification restrictions, the app will bring you to the settings page if the permission is not granted.

Features

- It's free
  Everyone should have the right to listen to music, therefore we aim to make it accessible.

- No advertisement
  We simply want a distraction-free experience for you, so you can relax and enjoy!

- Compact
  Less than 20 kB in size, one of the tiniest audio player apps on Android! No need to worry about bloated apps again.

- Unbelievably compatible
  Strangely addicted to support, we believe that nobody should be excluded due to an older device. Therefore we have theoretical support starting all the way back from Android 1.0, and tested support on Android 2.3 and above. Isn't it amazing?

- Clean & Simple
  No awkward layout, no hidden options and straightforward, so you can focus on the content. Enjoyment is key, right?

- It simply works :)
  Even in the modern world, there is always something seeming to fail. Luckily for you, this app was designed to work just like it is supposed to. It supports all audio types that your device supports.

- Minimal permissions required
  Have you ever met an app asking for a bunch of unrelated permissions? Have you ever had some strange requests reminding you of a malware? **Not this app!** The only 3 required permissions are notification, foreground service and read storage permission, so you know it's safe to use.

- No hidden third-parties
  It is completely open-source, and uses as little third-party libraries as possible.

If you worry about size, compatibility or privacy, this is the best app for you!

We use the foreground service permission to provide audio playing while using other apps.
we use the notification permission to provide playback control for audio playing.
We use the read storage permission on older devices to open the audio files. (not required for newer devices)

Issues and pull requests are always welcome!

This application allows to create lists of tasks which can be individually managed. Each list contains a set of tasks. Each task can have a deadline, a reminder time and a list of subtasks. By setting a reminder time the user will be informed by a notification. It is possible to display all tasks in a calendar, to protect the app with a secret pin and to sort and prioritize tasks within a list. Colors indicate the urgency of a task (taking the deadline into account).

Features of Privacy Friendly To-Do List

1. PIN protection
Open the Settings menu to setup a PIN protection for your application. The PIN needs to be a number with 4 digits. You are asked for it every time you start the application / start the main view.

2. Reminder
You can set a reminder to your tasks that will notify you if a deadline is approaching. Settings provide you the possibility to enable a notification sound.

3. Widget
In addition, this app provides a widget that you can add to your device’s home screen. The widget presents you tasks that belong to a chosen list. Clicking on a task or its checkbox leads to the main view of Privacy Friendly To-Do List.

4. Progress by subtasks
By default, progress can be chosen freely by the user when creating or editing a task. To-Do List gives the opportunity to automatically compute and show the progress of a task dependent on its done subtasks. Therefore go to Settings and enable progress by subtasks.

Our Privacy Friendly App differs from other applications with respect to three aspects:

1) Minimal permissions
Privacy Friendly To-Do List does not use more permissions than are strictly necessary to provide its functionality.

2) No advertisement
Privacy Friendly To-Do List completely relinquishes advertisement.
Many other free apps in the Google Play Store dazzle annoying advertising which also shortens battery life.

3) No tracking
Privacy Friendly To-Do List does not use any trackers.

Privacy Friendly To-Do List is part of the Privacy Friendly Apps group developed by the research group SECUSO at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. More information at: https://secuso.org/pfa

<b>Tasks:</b>
You can create, change and delete tasks.
Each task has a name, a category, a priority (HIGH, MEDIUM, or LOW), and a completion-status (i.e. it is either OPEN or DONE).
Optionally, each task can also have a description (arbitrary text), a due_date and a due_time.
In order to avoid unintentional deletion, a task can only be deleted if it is DONE.

<b>Categories:</b>
You can create as many categories as you need.
The category a task belongs to can be changed.
A category can be renamed. This will affect all tasks that belong to that category.
Unused categories can be deleted. I.e. deletion is only possible if the category has no tasks, and if it is not used in the current filter.

<b>Filtering tasks:</b>
It is possible to restrict the tasks displayed in the list, e.g. completed tasks only, or tasks with low priority only, etc.
In general, the tasks to be displayed in the list can be filtered by
* completion_status
* due_date/due_time
* priority
* category
or any combination of these.

For due_date there are several predefined filter options, e.g. TODAY, CURRENT_WEEK, OVERDUE, TASKS_WITHOUT_DATE, etc.

For priority and category, it is possible to filter with more than one option. E.g. you can choose to show tasks with priorities HIGH or MEDIUM. Or you can display all tasks that have either category ""Family"" or ""Friends"".

<b>Sorting tasks:</b>
The task list can be sorted by:
* completion_status
* due_date/due_time
* priority
* category
* name
Any sort order is possible. E.g. first by due_date/time, then by completion status, category, priority and name. Or any other order you prefer.

<b>Searching tasks:</b>
Tasks can be searched by text. The search text you enter can be applied to the task name, the task description, or both.
Case-sensitive search is possible.
In the list of search results, when displaying details of a task, the search string is highlighted in the task name and / or description.

<b>Convenience:</b>
There are shortcuts for often used actions. E.g.
* From the context menu of a category you can jump to a list of all tasks for that category.
* From the context menu of a task you can change its completion_status, set it to DONE (or OPEN respectively), or set its due date to today or tomorrow.
* When the task list is filtered by ""tasks due TODAY"", you can easily move to the previous / next day by swiping right / left.
* Similarly, by swiping you can easily move to the previous / next week (when the task list is filtered by ""tasks due CURRENT_WEEK""), or to the previous / next category (when all tasks for a category are displayed).

<b>Display:</b>
Tasks due in the past, today, or in the future have different background colors, so they are easily discernible.
The color scheme adapts to the display mode of the underlying android. I.e. if dark mode is selected (provided your android does support dark mode), a dark color scheme is used also for toodoo.

<b>Import / Export:</b>
All user data (i.e. tasks, categories, filters and sort criteria) can be exported to an external file (xml-format).
Vice versa, data can be imported from an external file.

<b>Technical:</b>
Your data is stored locally on your device.
No connection to the internet needed.
No ads. No tracking.


<b>Restrictions</b>
toodoo is minimalistic. It focuses on managing, categorizing, filtering, and sorting tasks (however, more features may be added in future releases.)
Thus, there are some restriction, i.e.:

* The user interface is in English only.

* Name of folder and file for export data are fixed (i.e. /Download/toodoo/toodooData-yyyy-mm-dd-hh-mm-ss)

* Settings are currently fixed, e.g.
- date format is yyyy-mm-dd, time format is 24 hours.
- first day of week is Monday.
- within a day, tasks without due_time are sorted behind tasks with due_time.

New in Version  3.6.0:
- Option to preselect species names by initial letters for editing them in the counting list
- App gets completely removed from memory when finished
- Code improvements
- Bug fixes
- Docs updated

Features:
- Data recording is organized for a regional tour with its expected butterfly species.
- Databases can be individually created and adapted within the app regarding meta data and expected butterfly species.
- The app has an internal pool of many European species and comes with a prepared basic database with the most common species in Europe as a starting point for direct use.
- Separate counters for ♂-♀-indeterminate, ♂, ♀, pupa, larva or egg.
- You may use an individual species list per region.
- Results are prepared for easy readout to transfer them to the science4you entry mask for butterfly registration.
- Results may be exported in SQLite- or CSV-format (for transfer to a PC for your own processing, e.g. in a spreadsheet.)
- Help contains a detailed userguide.

Functions:
- Editor for metadata in preparation for an inspection
- Counter page with scroll-down list for species selection
- Editor for individual species data of a count (e.g. status, remark or bulk count entry).
- The app automatically inserts date, time, coordinates and height as well as location data by reverse OSM-geocoding provided that GPS and internet are accessible.
- The app provides functions to add, delete or edit the species for the current species list.
- The results page shows metadata, notes, totals and counting results per species.

Prerequisites:
The app demands for 
- storage access permit for importing and exporting counting data,
- GPS (Location) permit for coordinates and location info per count, 
- internet access for OpenStreetMap reverse geocoding requests, 
- the permit to set the screen brightness,
- the permit to prevent the sleep mode.

The smartphone screen should have a minimum resolution of 1920 x 1024 pixels. 
The app is usable with Android version 7.1 (Nougat) or newer.

Documentation is provided under  
https://github.com/wistein/TourCount/tree/master/docs.

TourCount is one of two apps for European butterfly monitoring. 
The 2nd app, TransektCount serves transect counters on their inspection walks. It supports species-specific counting of butterflies per transect section according to the European Butterfly Monitoring Scheme method.

Both apps use the coding scheme of Karsholt/Razowski for European butterflies and thus contain only European butterfly pictures.

Categorize it with different tasks. Generate reports.,"This app can track your work time easily! You can automate time tracking using geo-fencing functions (see below). You may also categorize each recorded interval by a predefined client/task and a free text. Of course, the list of clients/tasks can be edited to suit your needs, and the app has a widget for your home screen.

Additionally, if you wish, your flexible time account is taken care of: you always see how much you worked. You can also keep an eye on how much work time is left for today or for the current week (by a notification which you can enable).

The app enables you to modify the planned working time effortlessly - just tap on the date you want to edit in the main table.

You may provide the geo-coordinates of your work place and the app can automatically clock you in while you are at work. This is done without using GPS, so your battery won't be emptied by this app.

You also may provide a Wi-Fi network name which is visible at your work place the app can use to clock in automatically when this SSID is in range (you don't need to be connected to this network). Of course you should have Wi-Fi enabled for this to work.

You don't want to open the app for clocking in and out? No problem - there are at least three ways to do that: add the widget to your home screen, use launcher shortcuts (long press the app icon for that) or add a new quick settings tile to your panel by tapping on the pencil below and dragging the ""Track Work Time"" tile up which then can toggle your clocked-in state.

If you prefer to use other apps like LlamaLab Automate or Tasker for tracking your movements, that's fine - TWT can be triggered from other apps and just do the book-keeping of your work time. In this case, you have to create broadcast intents called org.zephyrsoft.trackworktime.ClockIn or org.zephyrsoft.trackworktime.ClockOut. When using ClockIn, you can also set the parameters task=... and text=... in the ""extra"" section of the intent so your events are more meaningful. You can also use the action org.zephyrsoft.trackworktime.StatusRequest to get the current state of TWT: is the user clocked in, and if so, with which task and how much time remains for today? For more details on this, see the web site.

It's also possible the other way around: TWT generates broadcast intents on event creation/update/deletion. Automation apps can listen for the actions org.zephyrsoft.trackworktime.event.Created, org.zephyrsoft.trackworktime.event.Updated and org.zephyrsoft.trackworktime.event.Deleted. See the web site for more details and some screenshots on how to use it.

If you have a Pebble smart watch, the app will notify you on clock-in and clock-out events which is especially useful if you want to be in the know about automatic time tracking via location and/or WiFi.

For other smart watches you can enable some options regarding notifications to help you. Firstly, you can enable the notification generally. Without any other related option, this will only display a notification on your phone in case you're clocked in. To also display this notification on your phone when not clocked in, select to always show it. Now, if you want it also on your watch, you also have to switch notifications to non-persistent (otherwise Android won't synchronize them). This is kind of a compromise because with this option notifications won't be pinned at the top of the list and also can be closed unintentionally (but will be displayed again after a minute). In addition you can silence all notifications so you are not distracted by them (this will be applied on your watch as well as on your phone, Android doesn't differentiate here).

If you want to back up your data, you have the choice: use Google's mechanism or do it on your own. To use Google's servers just enable the corresponding option. And if you don't want to give your data to Google: The app automatically creates a backup each day which is written to the directory you allowed for the app (if you didn't allow",1

Trackbook is great for hiking, vacationing, or working out. Once started, it traces your movements on a map. The map data is provided by OpenStreetMap (OSM).

Trackbook is free software. It is published under the MIT open-source license. Trackbook uses osmdroid to display the map, which is also free software published under the Apache License.

GOOD TO KNOW
------------

START RECORDING VIA QUICK SETTINGS TILE
You can start a recording without opening Trackbook. Just pull down the System's Quick Settings and tap on the Start Recording tile. You'll need to manually add Trackbook's Recording tile to Quick Settings first. Information on customizing Quick Settings:
https://support.google.com/android/answer/9083864
https://www.xda-developers.com/get-custom-quick-settings-tiles/

SAVE RECORDINGS AS GPX
Recordings can be exported as GPX (GPS Exchange Format). Tap on the save button in the lower-right corner of a previously recorded track.

COPY GPX FILES MANUALLY
Trackbook automatically generates GPX files for every recording. You can find them in the folder /Android/data/org.y20k.trackbook/files/gpx/ on your device's storage.

HOW DOES TRACKBOOK MEASURE DISTANCE?
Trackbook calculates the distance between markers and adds them up.

HOW DOES TRACKBOOK MEASURE ALTITUDE?
Many devices have altitude sensors (of varying accuracy). Trackbook compares the altitude of each new marker with the previously stored altitude. The difference is added to either the uphill or downhill elevation value.

WHAT DOES ACCURACY THRESHOLD MEAN?
Every location fix that Trackbook receives is associated with an accuracy estimate. You can look up how Android defines accuracy in the developer documentation. ""Accuracy Threshold"" is the value from which location fixes are rejected. It can be adjusted in Trackbook's settings. You can increase the value if your recordings tend to be incomplete. Trackbook will then also record less accurate location fixes.

A WORD ON PRIVACY
-----------------
Trackbook begins to store location data on a device as soon as a user presses the record button. Those recordings are stored in the directory /Android/data/org.y20k.trackbook/files/. They never leave the device. There is no web-service backing Trackbook.

Trackbook does not use Google Play Services to get its location data. It will, however, try to use data from the NETWORK_PROVIDER on your device to augment the location data it received via GPS. The NETWORK_PROVIDER is a system-wide service that Trackbook has no control over. This service will usually query an online database for the location of cell towers or Wi-Fi access points a device can see. You can prevent those kinds of requests on your device if you set the location preferences system-wide to ""Device Only"". Additionally, Trackbook offers a ""Restrict to GPS"" setting that deactivates the NETWORK_PROVIDER just within the app.

To detect tracking, TrackerControl combines the power of the Disconnect blocklist, used by Firefox, and our in-house blocklist is used, created from analysing <i>~2 000 000</i> apps! Additionally, TrackerControl supports custom blocklists.

This approach

- reveals the companies behind tracking,
- allows to block tracking selectively, and
- exposes the purposes of tracking, such as analytics or advertising.

The app also aims to educate about your rights under Data Protection Law, such the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

Under the hood, TrackerControl uses Android's VPN functionality, to analyse apps' network communications <i>locally on the Android device</i>. This is accomplished through a local VPN server, to enable network traffic analysis by TrackerControl.

No root is required, other VPNs or Private DNS are not supported. No external VPN server is used, to keep your data safe! TrackerControl even protects you against <i>DNS cloaking</i>, a popular technique to hide trackers in websites and apps.

TrackerControl will always be free and open source, being a research project.

It supports the species-specific counting of butterflies per transect section according to the European Butterfly Monitoring Scheme method.

New in Version 4.2.1:
- Backpressed logic on starting page improved
- Bugfix for starting the default camera if it is the only camera app
- Permissions handling improved
- Docs updated

Features:
- Data collection is based on a transect inspection
- Databases refer to a transect and can be individually created and customised within the app with regard to metadata, transect sections and expected species
- The app contains an internal list with many European species and has a prepared database for a transect section with the most common species to be expected in Germany as a starting point for direct use.
- Separate counters for internal/external counting areas and separately for ♂-♀-indeterminate, ♂, ♀, pupa, caterpillar or egg
- Results page with prepared presentation for transfer to the input mask of Butterfly Monitoring Germany (www.tmd-daten.de or new: web.app.ufz.de/tagfalter-monitoring/)
- The result can be output as an SQLite DB file or as a CSV table (e.g. for transfer and further use in a spreadsheet programme on a PC)
- The help contains detailed user instructions

Functions:
- Duplicate and delete transect sections.
- Editing the transect section lists (adding and deleting species and editing terms).
- Editor for metadata in preparation for an inspection
- Counter page per section with scroll-down list for species selection
- Species editor for annotation, bulk counter entries and count alert
- The results page shows metadata, notes, totals and counting results per species and transect section

Prerequisites:
The app requires
- storage access permit for importing and exporting counting data, 
- the permit to set the screen brightness, 
- the permit to prevent the sleep mode.

The smartphone screen should have a minimum resolution of 1920 x 1024 pixels. 
The app can be used with Android version 7.1 (Nougat) or newer.

Documentation is provided under:
https://github.com/wistein/TransektCount/tree/master/docs.

TransektCount is one of two apps for monitoring European butterflies. 
The second app, TourCount, supports the species-specific and individually GPS-localised counting of butterflies on any walk in nature. 

Both apps use the coding scheme of Karsholt/Razowski for European butterflies and thus contain only European butterfly pictures.

Transportr is a non-profit app developed by people around the world in their free time.
They want to make the use of public transport as easy as possible for everybody.

This app uses the data of various local public transport agencies
and provides a unified interface for them.
It can not verify the correctness of the data
and therefore <i>offers no guarantees</i> for the displayed information.
Please use at your own risk.

It will find the best connections for you, advises you where to change buses,
and even gives you an estimated time of arrival.

<b>⏱️ Live Departures</b>. Shows upcoming departures from any and all stations.
In <i>supported</i> areas, real-time delays will be shown as well.

<b>🗽 Software Freedom</b>. The source code for Transportr is 100% open.
You can freely use, study, share and improve it.
This app is only as good as <i>you</i> make it.
You can even add your city yourself, if it is not already supported.

<b>🛰️ Finds your Position.</b> Transportr uses GPS satellite navigation
to keep track of your current position - so you never get lost.
You can find nearby stations to start a new trip
and then see how far along the journey you are.

<b>🌟 Remembers Favorite Places.</b> To get you where you need to go faster,
Transportr saves frequently used locations and trips.
That way you do not need to type them over and over again.

<b>🚫 No Ads, No Tracking</b>. This app does not display ads
or annoying notifications.
It also does not use tracking tools such as Google Analytics to spy on you.

<b>🗺️ Beautiful Maps</b>. Displays stations or your entire trip on a map

It was tested on a Galaxy Tab S6 and a Pixel 4.

This project was created with the goal of getting a workable VNC client on android to use my Galaxy Tab S6 with its Keyboard Book Cover as a linux machine. All other clients I've tested would not accept certain Hardware keys (like AltGr or combinations) and thus were not usable for serious Work.

Currently the client fits the framebuffer to the display size (thus no zooming and panning at the moment).

<h6>Disclaimer</h6>
<p>
Neither is this an officail project by the TU Darmstadt nor by Moodle. This is just started by me, a student at the TU Darmstadt, that has to much spare time.
</p>

<p>
The Moodle at the TU Darmstadt regularly sends me mails with Moodle links to courses, forum posts and other content on Moodle. I always read those
mails on my android phone, but clicking on those links from the mails results in opening the browser. I installed the official Moodle App, and wanted the links to open in the Moodle App.
As this is not nativly supported by the Moodle App, I sat down and coded this little app, that redirects links to the Moodle App.
</p>

<p>
After the app was finished, I wondered, if someone else could find this useful. The app is minimal and easy to use. Just install it, and all
supported links can be opened in Moodle.
</p>

<h6>Prerequisites</h6>
<p>
You will need to have and android phone with at least Android 6.0 Marshmallow and the official Moodle App with at least version 2 installed.
</p>

<h6>Which moodle links are supported?</h6>
This app supports the folloing Moodle URLs (https only):
<ul>
    <li>moodle.tu-darmstadt.de (standard Moodle)</li>
    <li>moodle.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de (computer science Moodle)</li>
    <li>vorkurs.mathematik.tu-darmstadt.de/moodlevorkurs (Moodle for the mathematicans preliminary course)</li>
    <li>wwwdid.mathematik.tu-darmstadt.de/moodle (some other probably outdated Moodle installation I found)</li>
    <li>moodle-exam.tu-darmstadt.de (moodle installation for online exams)</li>
    <li>moodle.chor.tu-darmstadt.de (moodle of the TU choir)</li>
</ul>

<p>
If the TU Darmstadt has any other Moodle URLs I should include, open an issue and let me know.
</p>

<h6>How to uninstall the app?</h6>
<p>
The app won't show up on your home screen. This is intended, as there is no need for a home screen icon.
To uninstall the app, open your System Settings -> Apps -> search for ""TU Darmstadt Moodle Wrapper"".

<br><b>Features:</b>

* Binding UDP socket on specified port and exchanging traffic between all known peers
* Exchanging traffic between multiple UDP sockets
* Remembering specified number of peers that have sent us some datagram, with optional expiration policy
* Directly specifying peers to send datagrams to. Combined with remembering, it allows using the application as UDP forwarder.
* Joining multicast groups, setting TTL, TOS, read and write buffer sizes and other socket options.
* Periodical sending of hardcoded datagrams to specified peers (e.g. to keep NAT open)
* Displaying of detailed statistics of the traffic
* Starting multiple isolated hubs, each with distinct set of ports. Can even act as a simplistic load balancer due to <code>SO_REUSEPORT</code>.

The application does not send datagrams back to sender.

<br><b>Limitations:</b>

* UI is not user-friendly.
* Not all features are exposed in GUI - you may want to add some undocumented fields to the JSON manually.
* Not very optimised for speed or latency. It may be slightly slower than socat udp4-l udp.
* Not everything is tested yet
* Documentation is lacking

What is a patch?
A file with the modified data of the game. For example, a game translated from Japanese to English. You download the patch containing the translation. It must be applied to the Japanese version to make an English version of it.

This program will not help you hack native Android games, it was created for the old console games (SNES, PS1, GBA, N64, SMD\Genesis etc.)

Features:
* Supported formats of patches: IPS, IPS32, UPS, BPS, APS (GBA), APS (N64), PPF, DPS, EBP, XDelta3
* Create XDelta patches
* Fix the checksum in SMD\Genesis ROMs
* Remove the SMC header from SNES ROMs

How to use?
You have to select a ROM file, a patch and choose which file to save, then click on the red round button. Files are selected through the standard Files application (or through one of the file managers you have installed). The application will show a message when the file is patched. Do not close the application until the file is patched.

Very important:
If the game and patch is compressed (ZIP, RAR, 7z or other), they first need to be unzipped.",1

It is engineered to serve privacy-conscious individuals looking to manage and invest in Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies in a sovereign and professional manner.

Unstoppable is built with the following in mind:

- Capital Should Be Free >> It’s built to provide users with genuinely independent control over their capital.

- Capital Should Be Borderless >> It works outside the traditional finance layer and acts as a Swiss knife to the world of decentralized finances (DeFi).

- Capital Should Be Private >> It doesn’t leak private data, it has no means to track users, and takes extra measures to ensure privacy on multiple layers.

If the above rhymes well with you then Unstoppable is for you! And we are here to focus on your unique needs and serve you in the best possible manner.

WALLET FEATURES:

- Non-Custodial Multi-wallet >> Manage any number of cryptocurrencies across multiple portfolio-style wallets in a non-custodial manner. This wallet is like your own bank where you are the only client and the only one in charge. It’s designed to keep assets secure and easy to restore even if the phone is stolen and tampered with.

- Investment Oriented Wallet >> Unstoppable brings unmatched cryptocurrency market analytics to your device: advanced sorting, curated categorization, extensive search filtering, and event-based alerting features.

- Universal Wallet >> It supports all mainstream blockchains and is built in a standard compliant manner enabling users to use just one wallet app for everything crypto.

- A Bitcoin Wallet >> The wallet packs some of the most advanced Bitcoin features available: SPV enabled, BIP 44/49/84/86/69 compliant, Bitcoin timelocks, custom transaction fees, and more.

- A DeFi Wallet >> Full support for decentralized token swaps on Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Avalanche, Solana, and more. Also, the ability to interact with any smart contract-powered service on the blockchain via the WalletConnect protocol.

- Ethereum Wallet >> Full support for Ethereum blockchain, its growing ecosystem of tokens (ERC20, NFT tokens, etc.), and other decentralized services such as ENS (Ethereum Name Service).

- Ethereum L2 Wallet >> Artbitrum, Optimism, Polygon support.

- Avalanche Wallet >> Full support for Avalanche C-Chain blockchain.

- Binance Wallet >> Full support for original Binance Chain (incl. BEP2) and Binance Smart Chain.

- Crypto Academy >> The app includes two courses meant to onboard newcomers into the world of cryptocurrencies and the DeFi ecosystem in an easy-to-digest manner covering essential aspects of cryptocurrency security, storage, privacy, transacting, and exchanging.

- Wallet for Privacy Coins >> Fully supports major privacy coins (ZCash, DASH) in an SPV manner. One of the very few wallets capable of supporting fully shielded Zcash transactions as well as the ability to privatize Bitcoin transactions.

- Decentralized Wallet >> Designed to work with most major blockchains in a decentralized manner where an app doesn't depend on some server of a wallet provider to send/receive transactions but interacts with blockchain networks directly.

- Privacy Focused >> Designed to allow for privacy even in the most privacy-breaching scenarios. There are no user accounts keeping your records, no identity checks that risk exposing your financials to the world, and no interaction with traditional finance layers. The app is partially TOR enabled and VPN support coming soon.

- Fully Open Source >> The most transparent wallet application built to date. The entire 4-year production process of the app is openly accessible online along with 100% of its code for anyone to evaluate or reuse in other projects. Verified and audited by third parties.

When you do so, a window containing information about the url is displayed, allowing you to make changes to it as well.
Specially useful when you need to open an external link either from an email, a social network app or others.


URLCheck is developed by TrianguloY, originally for personal use. It is open source (under CC BY 4.0 license), free, without any ads or trackers, light sized and using as few permissions as necessary (only the internet permission, for module checks that will only be performed when the user request them). The source code is available on GitHub too, if you want to suggest changes, perform modifications or propose a new translation: https://github.com/TrianguloY/URLCheck


The app is structured with a modular setup, you can enable/disable and reorder individual modules, which include:

* Input text: Displays the current url which can be edited manually. Can't be disabled.

* History: View and revert any change from other modules, including edits from the user (typical undo/redo feature)

* Log: Keeps a log of all checked urls, which you can view, edit, copy, clear...

* Status code: By pressing the button a network request will be made to retrieve that url, and the status code will be displayed (ok, server error, not found...). Additionally, if it corresponds to a redirection, press the message to check the new url. The url is fetched, but not evaluated, so redirection based on javascript won't be detected.

* Url Scanner: Allows you to scan the url using VirusTotal, and check the report. A free personal VirusTotal API key is needed for it to work. VirusTotal™ is a trademark of Google, Inc.

* Url Cleaner: Uses the ClearURLs catalog to remove referral and useless parameters from the url. It also allows for common offline url redirections. Built-in catalog from https://docs.clearurls.xyz/latest/specs/rules/

* Unshortener: Uses https://unshorten.me/ to unshorten urls remotely.

* Queries remover: Displays the decoded individual url queries, which you can remove or check.

* Pattern module: Checks the url with regex patterns that warns, suggests or applies replacements. You can modify or create your own patterns, or even use user-created ones.
Built-in patterns include:
    - Warning when contains non-ascii characters like greek letters. This can be used for phishing: googĺe.com vs google.com
    - Suggest replacing 'http' with 'https'
    - Suggest replacing Youtube, Reddit or Twitter with privacy-friendly alternatives [disabled by default]

* Hosts checker: This module labels hosts, configured either by specifying them manually or by using a remote hosts-like file. You can use it to warn about dangerous or special sites. The builtin configuration specifies StevenBlack's hosts (adware/malware, fakenews, gambling and adult content) from https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts

* Debug module: Displays the intent uri, and optionally info about the ctabs (custom tabs) service. This is intended for developers.

* Open module: Contains the open and share buttons. If a link can be opened with multiple apps, an arrow will be shown to let you choose. Can't be disabled.

The app connects to a usb camera from your Android Device. (OTG cabel or OTG Hub needed)

This Project was built to perform an Isochronous Video Stream for all Android Devices (Above 4.1 Ice Cream Sandwich)(Mediathek Devices too) with UVC Cameras.
The program uses your userspacr usb device driver to perform an isochronous transfer with your camera device.

Follow this way to set up your own userspace device driver:

First you have to set up all camera settings for your device. The program then saves the values and you can restore them later or overwrite them with other values. Use the ""Edit/Save/Restore"" Button to adjust the values.
Use the automatic camera serarch to find and set up the camera.
Explaination:

When the automatic search succeeds, you first set up the MAXIMAL PACKET SIZE. If your device is a mediathek device, you may have to lower the value for the max packet size.
The Value PACKETS PER REQUEST defines the Number of the Packets sended to the device: One packet has a size of 3000 bytes and you use 16 packets at one time for sending. Here you define the amount of Bytes which were sent.
Next thing are the USB REQUEST BLOCKS (activeUrb): These are in relation to the max packet size. You have to find here the right values for your device and control the output on the screen under the menupoint ""Isoread"".
Some typically values for Qualcom Devices are: 8 for the activeUrbs and 16 Packets per Request....
The first thing of the method Isoread is a Controltransfer to the camera device:

If the controlltransfer is successful, than you are ready to go.

Next take a look at the frames.

When you receive identically and long frames, you can proceed to the method Isostream, where the frames were displayed on your screen.

To know how big be a Frame should be, you can look at the output of the controll transfer of the camera in the log: maxVideoFrameSize, This value is returned from the camera and should be the valid frame size (The value is calculated by Imagewidth x Imagehight x 2).

The IsochronousRead1 class shows you how the frames are structered by the camera. Different camerasetting == Different Frame structers. Try it out with different setting and look at the output. The eof hint shows the framesize in the log. For valid camera settings the size should be the same as maxFrameSize value of the controlltransfer.

Output method Isoread: (Controltransfer) Thirst the program will send a controlltransfer to your camera device. The output of it looks as following: Initial streaming parms: hint=0x0 format=1 frame=1 frameInterval=2000000 keyFrameRate=0 pFrameRate=0 compQuality=0 compWindowSize=0 delay=0 maxVideoFrameSize=0 maxPayloadTransferSize=0 Probed streaming parms: hint=0x0 format=1 frame=1 frameInterval=2000000 keyFrameRate=0 pFrameRate=0 compQuality=0 compWindowSize=0 delay=0 maxVideoFrameSize=614400 maxPayloadTransferSize=3000 Final streaming parms: hint=0x0 format=1 frame=1 frameInterval=2000000 keyFrameRate=0 pFrameRate=0 compQuality=0 compWindowSize=0 delay=0 maxVideoFrameSize=614400 maxPayloadTransferSize=3000 The first line are the values you set in the program, to connect the camera. (Initial streaming parms}

The secound line are the values from the camera, which the camera returned from your values.

And in the third line are the new saved and final values from the usb camera.

Outpuf from the first Method: isoRead:

EOF frameLen=10436. --> For Example here a frame ends with a length of 10436 wich is not 614400 as we expected from the controltransfer, so you may have to change some values of you program to get a valid frame size.",1

<p>VoIP.ms SMS is an Android messaging app for VoIP.ms that seeks to replicate the aesthetic of <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.messaging"">Google&#39;s official SMS app</a>.</p>
<b>Features</b>
• Material design
• Push notifications (if using the Google Play version of the app)
• Synchronization with device contacts
• Message search
• Comprehensive support for synchronization with VoIP.ms
• Completely free
</ul>
<b>Rationale</b>
<p>A number of people use VoIP.ms as a cheaper alternative to subscribing to a voice plan for their mobile devices.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this can make sending text messages rather difficult, as the <a href=""https://voip.ms/m/sms.php"">VoIP.ms SMS Message Center</a> is clearly built as a diagnostic tool for use in desktop browsers, not as an easy way to send and receive messages on a mobile device.</p>
<p>VoIP.ms does provide a <a href=""https://sms.voip.ms/"">mobile version</a> of this interface with an improved UI, but it still lacks important features that are only possible with a dedicated app.</p>
<b>Installation</b>
<p>The standard version of the app uses closed-source Firebase libraries to support push notifications and facilitate crash reporting and analytics, among other purposes. A version of the application that is completely open source is available from F-Droid.</p>
<p>Both versions are available from the <a href=""https://github.com/michaelkourlas/voipms-sms-client/releases"">Releases section</a> of the GitHub repository.</p>
<b>Documentation</b>
<p>The app&#39;s documentation is available in the <a href=""https://github.com/michaelkourlas/voipms-sms-client/blob/master/HELP.md"">HELP.md file</a>.</p>
<b>License</b>
<p>VoIP.ms SMS is licensed under the <a href=""http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0"">Apache License 2.0</a>.</p>

No more mental math before bed - after a single button press, your head can hit the pillow and you will <i>warp</i> forwards in time with minimal interruption.

<b>How to use</b>

When you open Warpclock for the first time, you should configure your preferred amount of sleep using the in-app controls. There are buttons to increase and decrease the amount by 1 hour, 10 minutes, and 1 minute. You only need to set this once.

There is also a button labeled ""Set alarm"" inside the app. Pressing this button will create a new one-shot alarm in your default alarm clock app, configured to wake you up after your personalized amount of time has passed. The alarm will automatically delete itself from your alarm app once it has triggered, keeping your list of saved alarms clean.

Once the alarm is created, you'll get two toast notifications. The first notification is from Warpclock, displaying the time that the new alarm should go off. The second notification comes from the system alarm clock, confirming that it was created sucessfully and displaying how far in the future the alarm will occur.


The app also exposes a widget that you can add to your homescreen for even faster access.

In the default launcher, just long-press on your homescreen background and drag the ""Warpclock"" widget to a location on your homescreen, and drag the edges to resize as desired. Tapping on the widget text will create a new alarm just as if you'd pressed the ""Set alarm"" button in the app. You'll get the same two toast notifications as well.


The alarm is created in your default alarm clock app, so you should use that to configure the default alarm sound and vibration settings. Once an alarm is created, if the trigger time needs to be adjusted, that should also be done in the default alarm clock app.

<b>Current limitations</b>
This app currently does not handle Daylight Savings Time changes, it simply adds the configured amount and rolls over at 24 hours. You'll need to manually fix a couple of alarms per year if you live in a region that still changes the time back and forth.

WhatsApp's recent privacy policy changes have triggered a huge migration to more privacy friendly apps like Signal and others.

I have developed this app because I wanted to avoid pressing the power button just to take a look at the watch - which I happen to do a lot on my phone. There are already other apps that do exactly this - and even more. I was inspired by Gravity Screen On/Off, which is a <b>great</b> app. However, I am a huge fan of open source software and try to install free software (free as in freedom, not only free as in free beer) on my phone if possible. I wasn't able to find an open source app that did this so I just did it myself. If you're interested, you can take a look at the code:
https://gitlab.com/juanitobananas/wave-up

Just wave your hand over the proximity sensor of your phone to turn the screen on. This is called <i>wave mode</i> and can be disabled in the settings screen in order to avoid accidental switching on of your screen.

It will also turn on the screen when you take your smartphone out of your pocket or purse. This is <i>called pocket mode</i> and can also be disabled in the settings screen.

Both of these modes are enabled by default.

It also locks your phone and turns off the screen if you cover the proximity sensor for one second (or a specified time). This does not have a special name but can nonetheless be changed in the settings screen too. This is not enabled by default.

For those who have never heard proximity sensor before: it is a small thingie that is somewhere near where you put your ear when you speak on the phone. You practically can't see it and it is responsible for telling your phone to switch off the screen when you're on a call.

<b>Known issues</b>

Unfortunately, some smartphones let the CPU on while listening to the proximity sensor. This is called a <i>wake lock</i> and causes considerable battery drain. This isn't my fault and I cannot do anything to change this. Most phones, however, will ""go to sleep"" when the screen is turned off while still listening to the proximity sensor, resulting in practically zero battery drain.

<b>Use of Accessibility Services:</b>

▸ Purpose: Starting with Android 9, WaveUp utilizes the Accessibility Services API to allow users to switch off the screen.
▸ Privacy and Security: WaveUp uses the Accessibility Services API exclusively for this purpose and only if the 'lock' option is enabled. No personal data is collected, stored, or shared through this service.
▸ Permission Scope: The Accessibility Services permission is strictly used for enabling the screen lock feature. It does not monitor or interact with any other aspect of device usage.

<b>Required Android Permissions:</b>

▸ WAKE_LOCK to turn on the screen
▸ RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED to automatically startup on boot if selected
▸ READ_PHONE_STATE to suspend WaveUp while on a call
▸ BLUETOOTH (or BLUETOOTH_CONNECT for Android 10 and abve) to detect bluetooth headsets while on a call and not suspend WaveUp
▸ REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS, FOREGROUND_SERVICE and FOREGROUND_SERVICE_SPECIAL_USE to keep running in the background (which is vital for WaveUp in order to always listen to the proximity sensor)
▸ USES_POLICY_FORCE_LOCK to lock the device for Android 8 and below (this forces the user to use a pattern or pin if set)
▸ BIND_ACCESSIBILITY_SERVICE (Accessibility API) to turn off the screen for Android 9 and above.
▸ REQUEST_DELETE_PACKAGES to uninstall itself (if USES_POLICY_FORCE_LOCK was used)

<b>Uninstalling on Android 8 and older</b>

This app uses the Device Administrator permission to provide enhanced functionality, which means you cannot uninstall WaveUp in the usual way.

To uninstall it, open the app and use the 'Uninstall WaveUp' button at the bottom of the menu. This will deactivate the Device Administrator permission and uninstall the app directly.

By performing free tests with Wehe on your mobile device, you are participating in an IRB-approved research project at Northeastern University (led by Dr. David Choffnes) and you are helping to identify potential violations of net neutrality. Note that no conclusion can be drawn from an individual result of the type ""Differentiation detected"" to characterize a breach of Regulation (EU) 2015/2120 on Open Internet.

As net neutrality regulations vary according to location, Wehe collects coarse-grained geolocation data (with a precision of 0.1 degrees latitude/longitude) if users explicitly opt in to providing it. Wehe never collects fine-grained geolocation information. Wehe also collects IP addresses, which are stored as truncated data so they cannot be tied to individuals. As such, all the collected data are deidentified to guarantee the protection of personal data. The deidentified data are published as open data to let third parties reproduce the conclusions of the tests carried out. Finally, Wehe uses servers located around the world, including ones hosted by Measurement Lab (M-Lab). M-Lab collects additional measurement data from clients, but does so in a way that is consistent with Wehe’s protections against collecting personal data. Note that the set of servers and hosts may change over time, but our privacy policy and data protection practices remain the same.

No personal data are either transferred, or exchanged, or rented. In accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) n°2016/679, please note that you have the right to oppose, access, rectify, delete, limit or transfer your personal data.

You can dial numbers and receive calls. It does not do anything you do not need, e.g. provide a contact list that your system contact App alrady contains.

The special feature of Welefon is an API that allows a seamlessly integration of other apps in your phone experience. The Welefon source code contains an example App that uses the API in the folder apidemoapp.

Using this API, other Apps can receive details about the current calls. Like the deprecated PhoneStateListener of Android, this contains the phone number. In contrast to the PhoneStateListener, you do not need to fear the removal of the API. Additionally, Welefon includes details of calls in the background, e.g. calls that are in the state ""hold"".

Welefon can receive additional caller details from other Apps. This can be a caller name, a caller details action and a RemoteView. The received caller name is shown as you expect it, completly independent of the system contact list. If a detail action is provided, then you can tap on the name to jump directly to the right place in the other App.

The RemoteViews are the method that allows Widgets on your homescreen. The same method can be used to show additional details and controls in the call screen. This allows showing any extra details.

Of course this is safe and secure: The Welefon API can only be used with your permission.

Tapping on the pencil icon on the left of a workout will go to the Edit Screen, tapping on the title or duration of a workout will start it from the beginning, tapping on the ""⌄"" symbol on the right will show a list of the exercises it contains. Each exercise has a preparation/rest time before it (shown on the left), and a duration (shown on the right). Tapping on an exercise in the list will start the workout at that exercise.

<b>Workout Screen</b>
When a workout is running there is a progress bar at the top showing the current point in the workout, with the time elapsed on the left and the time remaining (indicated with a ""-"") on the right. In between these two times are a series of dots that represent the exercises in the workout, with the current exercise highlighted in blue. Below this is the name of the current exercise. During the exercise preparation time the name will have ""Get ready for"" before it (tapping on this will skip the preparation and begin the exercise). Below the exercise name is a stopwatch showing the current progress in that exercise, with the remaining time in the middle. Tapping on the stopwatch will pause the workout (indicated by blinking time inside the stopwatch), and tapping again will resume it. At the bottom of the screen is the name of the next exercise. Tapping on this will skip to the next exercise.

<b>Edit screen</b>
Lists all exercises in a workout, with the preparation time on the left and the duration on the right. To change an exercise, tap on it and the two times will become spinners that can be swiped up or down to modify the time. Long-pressing on the spinner allows modifying the number with the keyboard (must be a number of seconds without any punctuation). Tapping on the exercise name will bring up the keyboard to edit it.

You can use it to exchange files between your phone and another Magic Wormhole client, including the original command-line client.

How to send files

* From the main screen, tap the ""send"" button. Then use the ""choose file"" button to pick the file that you want to send.
* Alternatively, open the file that you want to send and tap the share icon: Wormhole should be listed among the apps you can use to share the file.
* Either way, the app will have generated a code, a random number followed by two random words. The person to whom you want to send the file will have to enter this code in their Magic Wormhole client. The code is also copied to the clipboard for convenience.
* Tap the ""send"" button. When the user at the other end of the wormhole enters the code and confirms, the file will start transferring.
* The ""send"" button will change to ""done"" when the transfer is complete.

How to receive files

* From the main screen, tap the ""receive"" button.
* Enter the code that the sender has provided you with and tap the ""connect"" button.
* You will see the incoming file's name and size. If all looks good, tap the ""receive"" button to start the file transfer.
* When the file is downloaded from the wormhole, the ""receive"" button will change to an ""open dir"" button.

The app is still in beta and there is still a lot to be desired. However, the basic functionality of sending and receiving files seems to be there. I find it useful, so someone else might as well.

The code is <a href=""https://github.com/pavelsof/mobile-wormhole"">open sourced</a> under GPLv3. Pull requests are welcome.

* Automatic incremental/delta database updates (option).
* You can view online reviews for caller's number (provided by 3rd party service).
* ""Advanced call blocking mode"" for blocking calls on Android 7+ before the phone starts ringing (needs to be manually enabled in app Settings).

<b>How to use:</b>

* Install and launch the app.
* The option to show caller info notifications is enabled by default, so the app will ask for phone-related permissions.
* At first start, the app will suggest to download main database which is required for most of the functions. Simply confirm the download.
* Check the ""Auto-update database"" checkbox in the menu (recommended) to automatically receive daily DB updates (these are incremental/delta updates, so they consume very little traffic).
* Check the ""Block by rating"" checkbox to block calls with negative rating automatically.
* You can also check the ""Use contacts"" checkbox if you want your contacts not to be treated as unknown callers.
* After these steps everything should just work (but you can always find more options in Settings). Enjoy!

See <a href=""https://gitlab.com/xynngh/YetAnotherCallBlocker/-/blob/master/FAQ.md"">frequently asked questions</a> to learn more.

It is lightweight, self-arranging, supported on multiple platforms and allows pretty much any IPv6-capable application to communicate securely with other Yggdrasil nodes.
Yggdrasil does not require you to have IPv6 Internet connectivity - it also works over IPv4.

This app allows you to connect to Yggdrasil Network and use any service located in this network. It works as VPN service, but all your usual traffic will go trough your provider, not through Yggdrasil Network.

Also, it is not a goal of the Yggdrasil project to provide anonymity. Direct peers over the Internet will be able to see your IP address and may be able to use this information to determine your location or identity. Multicast-discovered peerings on the same network will typically expose your device MAC address. Other nodes on the network may be able to discern some information about which nodes you are peered with.

All traffic sent across the Yggdrasil network is encrypted end-to-end. Assuming that our crypto is solid, it cannot be decrypted or read by any intermediate nodes, and can only be decrypted by the recipient for which it was intended. However, please note that Yggdrasil has not been officially externally audited.",1

if you use widget on your phone or tablet, you can see your location and current weather on the main screen. Update of location could be used by some specific period (ex. hourly) or application can use accelerometer to detect movement. You can switch update of location off - weather only is updated in this case.

Update by specific period of time:
Application update the location and weather by specified amount of time. For example, you can set update period to one hour o'clock.

Update by accelerometer:
Location is updated by a distance counted by accelerometer. When distance is longer then minimal value for update, application update your location. Distance derived by accelerometer depends on the way how you carry your phone - when you carry your phone in a pocket the distance is increases faster - the phone is moving back and forth as you go. The weather is updated immediately after the update of location. The weather is updated when screen goes on too - but not more often then once per 15 minutes (and when weather is not updated in the last 15 minutes).

To get the location, cell network (BTS) and WIFIs available on the place are used. These information are used to get location coordinates by Mozilla location service. Application try to use GPS when location is not available from cell network and WIFIs. Location coordinates are used to get address by Nominatim service. The address is used in the application or widget.

Application uses OpenWeatherMap.org service to get current weather .

Additional features include:
    Different languages: Czech, Basque, Belarusian, Czech, English, French, German, Japanese, Spanish, Polish, Russian

You are the red tile on a square board and the aim is to delete almost every tile while trying to make the most points.

It's <b>so easy</b>!

<b>Modes:</b>

‣ Single player: play a random match and try to get the most points.
‣ Multiplayer: play against your opponents and defeat them.
‣ Levels: use your mind to solve each level by deleting all the tiles.

<b>Main features:</b>

★ Multiplayer mode for up to 4 players on the same device
★ 70+ unique levels
★ 10+ numeral systems
★ Completely free
★ No Ads
★ Multiple languages
★ Minimalist design and dark mode

<b>Rules:</b>

The rules may seem difficult at first glance but they are not.

Anyhow, the best way to learn is by playing! Levels mode is a good place to start.

1. You are the red tile on a square board.

2. Swipe horizontally or vertically to move.

3. When you move you reduce tiles value in the direction you are going.

    - The amount of this reduction is equal to your starting point tile value.

    - But if the value of a tile would be equal to 1 or 2, there will be an increase instead of a decrease.

    - Negative numbers become positive.

    - If the value of a tile becomes equal to zero, starting tile value becomes zero too. Tiles have been ""Deleted"".

4. You earn as many points as the value of the deleted tiles.

5. The aim is to delete almost every tile while trying to make the most points.

6. In multiplayer matches a player can win by deleting opponent's tile.

Source - https://github.com/corphish/NightLight

<b>Features</b>
🌈 Uses KCAL to adjust blue light intensity
🕹️ Easy to use color controls
🛏️ Bed time mode
⏱️ Automation routines
🌙 Intensity fade in/out
📕 Profiles
⚡ Tasker plugin integration
🔒 Lock screen options
😍 Great UI

🌈 KCAL FOR THE WIN! 🌈
KCAL is a display driver tuning feature for Qualcomm devices, written by savoca. This is used by Night Light to adjust blue light by manipulating screen RGB. Since the changes are done in driver level, this is THE MOST efficient blue light filter, with the changes being visible all over the screen anytime.

🕹️ COLOR CONTROLS 🕹️
Night Light provides both simple and advanced color controls for the user. For those who want one simple control, the color temperature control is for them, while for the advanced users, the app lets full screen RGB control.

🛏️ BED TIME MODE 🛏️
Bed time mode makes your screen grayscale which can help you to fall asleep faster.

⏱️ AUTOMATION ROUTINES ⏱️
With automation routines, you have total control on how Night Light settings are applied throughout the day. Set different routines for different time periods during which the Night Light intensity of your choice will be applied.

🌙 INTENSITY FADE IN/OUT 🌙
You can also choose to have Night Light fade in or out from one intensity to another intensity as part of an automation routine.

📕 PROFILES 📕
Night Light lets you create profiles, which are basically collection of settings, which you can easily apply later on with one click.

⚡ TASKER PLUGIN INTEGRATION ⚡
If the automation features provided by the app is not sufficient for you, then you can use Tasker to handle the automation for you while Night Light does the blue light adjustment the way you want. Night Light is supported as a plugin for Tasker. You can get Tasker from https://tasker.joaoapps.com/.

🔒 LOCK SCREEN 🔒
Can automatically turn off the Night Light in lock screen, and turn it back on when the device is unlocked.

😍 UI CAN BE SIMPLE YET AMAZING AT THE SAME TIME 😍
Night Light features a simple and attractive UI, which uses the best of what Material Design has to offer, and provides a very easy-to-use user interface. It provides a neat dashboard which provides one click controls for commonly used features. It also provides dark and light theme and icon customization.

The app uses Android's companion app feature, meaning that it does not actively scan for your camera, but is only started by Android when the camera has been seen by the system - and the app's service is shut down as soon as it is turned off again. The remote control buttons are there when you need them, but no resources or screenspace are used otherwise.

So far, this app has only been tested with the following cameras:
ILCE-6400 (α6400), ILCE-6700 (α6700), ILCE-7M3 (α7 III), ILCE-7CM2 (α7C II), ILCE-7M4 (α7 IV), ILCE-7RM3 (α7R III), ILCE-9 (α9), ZV-E10

It is expected to work with any Sony camera that supports Bluetooth remotes, including the following models:
DSC-RX100M7, DSC-RX100M7G, ZV-1, ILCE-7M4K, ILCE-7RM4A, ZV-E10, ZV-E10L, ILCE-1, ILCE-7C, ILCE-7CL, ILCE-7SM3, ILCE-9M2, ILCE-6100, ILCE-6100L ,ILCE-6100Y ,ILCE-6600, ILCE-6600M, ILCE-7RM4, ILCE-6400L, ILCE-6400M, ILCE-7M3, ILCE-7M3K, ILCE-7RM3, ILCE-9

If you have one of those cameras, I would be happy to get feedback on how well it works with this app.

You get home from the hospital, exhausted, with this little fragile unknown thingy that has no user manual and a single way to let you know something's not ok: crying.
You have to react fast, even if it's 4 AM and you have no idea why is crying.

This app is meant to log all the relevant events (diaper change, breastfeeding, baby bottle feeding...), so you can always remember when has been done last time. It supports syncing the data between different devices (using your WebDAV server for the best privacy) so that when the baby needs attentions, the dad can step in leaving the mom sleeping peacefully.

Dedicated to my daughter Luna.
